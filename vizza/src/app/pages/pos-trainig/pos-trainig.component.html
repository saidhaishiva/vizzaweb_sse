<!--<strong>1.1 Introduction</strong><br>-->
<!--A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of-->
<!--programs to access those data. This is a collection of related data with an implicit-->
<!--meaning and hence is a database. The collection of data, usually referred to as the-->
<!--database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is-->
<!--to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and-->
<!--efficient. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit-->
<!--meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the-->
<!--people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book, or you-->
<!--may have stored it on a diskette, using a personal computer and software such as DBASE-->
<!--IV or V, Microsoft ACCESS, or EXCEL. A datum – a unit of data – is a symbol or a set-->
<!--of symbols which is used to represent something. This relationship between symbols and-->
<!--what they represent is the essence of what we mean by information. Hence, information-->
<!--is interpreted data – data supplied with semantics. Knowledge refers to the practical use-->
<!--of information. While information can be transported, stored or shared without many-->
<!--difficulties the same can not be said about knowledge. Knowledge necessarily involves a-->
<!--personal experience. Referring back to the scientific experiment, a third person reading-->
<!--the results will have information about it, while the person who conducted the experiment-->
<!--personally will have knowledge about it.-->
<!--Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management of-->
<!--data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing-->
<!--mechanisms for the manipulation of information. In addition, the database system must-->
<!--ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or attempts at-->
<!--unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the system must avoid-->
<!--possible anomalous results.-->
<!--Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists have-->
<!--developed a large body of concepts and techniques for managing data. These concepts-->
<!--and technique form the focus of this book. This chapter briefly introduces the principles-->
<!--of database systems.-->

            <h2 id="one">INTRODUCTION TO INSURANCE</h2>
            <p align="justify">Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss. That is, promise of compensation for specific potential future losses in exchange for a periodic payment. Insurance is designed to protect the financial well-being of an individual, company or other entity against unexpected or unpredictable losses or expenses. An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance agent or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or a policyholder. Insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss</p>
            <h3 id="one1">Functions of Insurance</h3>
            <p align="justify">Functions of insurance can be divided into parts;</p>
            <ol type="I">
              <li>Primary functions.</li>
              <li>Secondary functions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Primary Functions</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Certainty of Compensation of Loss:</strong> Insurance provides certainty of payment at the uncertainty of loss. The elements of uncertainty are reduced by better planning and administration. The insurer charges premium for providing certainty.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance Provides Protection:</strong>The main function of insurance is to provide protection against risk of loss. The insurance policy covers the risk of loss. The insured person is indemnified for the actual loss suffered by him. Insurance thus provide financial protection to the insured. Life insurance policies may also be used as collateral security for raising loans.
            </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk Sharing:</strong>All business concerns face the problem of risk. Risk and insurance are interlinked with each other. Insurance, as a device is the outcome of the existence of various risks in our day to day life. It does not eliminate risks but it reduces the financial loss caused by risks. Insurance spreads the whole loss over the large number of persons who are exposed by a particular risk.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Functions</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Prevention of Losses:</strong>The insurance companies help in prevention of losses as they join hands with those institutions which are engaged in loss prevention measures. The reduction in losses means that the insurance companies would be required to pay lesser compensations to the assured and manage to accumulate more savings, which in turn, will assist in reducing the premiums</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Providing funds for investment:</strong>Insurance provide capital for society. Accumulated funds through savings in the form of insurance premium are invested in economic development plans or productivity projects.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance increases efficiency:</strong>The insurance eliminates the worries and miseries of losses. A person can devote his time to other important matters for better achievement of goals. Businessman feel more motivated and encouraged to take risks to enhance their profit earning. This also helps in improving their efficiencies.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Solution to social problems:</strong>Insurance take care of many social problems. We have insurance against industrial injuries, road accident, old age, disability or death etc.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Encouragement of savings:</strong>Insurance not only provides protection against risks but also a number of other incentives which encourages people to insure. Since regularity and punctuality pf payment of premium is a perquisite for keeping the policy in force, the insured feels compelled to save.</p>

            <p align="justify">The world we live in is full of uncertainties and risks. Individuals, families, businesses, properties and assets are exposed to different types and levels of risks. These include risk of losses of life, health, assets, property, and so on. While it is not always possible to prevent unwanted events from occurring, financial world has developed products that protect individuals and businesses against such losses by compensating them with financial resources. Insurance is a financial product that reduces or eliminates the cost of loss or effect of loss caused by different types of risks. Insurance is a shield which protects the financial interests of you and your family in case of unseen and unpredicted circumstances.

            <h4>Benefits to Individual</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Capital Formation:</strong> As institutional investors, insurance companies provide funds for financing economic development. They mobilize the saving of the people and invest these saving into more productive channels</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Generating Employment Opportunities:</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Promoting Social Welfare:</strong>Policies like old age pension scheme, policies for education, marriage provide sense of security to the policyholders and thus ensure social welfare.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Helps Controlling Inflation:</strong> The insurance reduces the inflationary pressure in two ways, first, by extracting money in supply to the amount of premium collected and secondly, by providing funds for production narrow down the inflationary gap.</p>
            <h3 id="one3">Types of Insurance</h3>
            <p>There are two basic types of insurance</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Life Insurance</li>
              <li>General Insurance</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Life Insurance</strong> pays the insured/policy holder or your beneficiaries a certain sum of money in case of your death. Since the insurance coverage is more than a year, the insured/policyholder has to pay the premium either every month, every three months or annually. Risks involved: are: your premature death, your source of income during retirement or in case of your illness. Its main products comprise life-time policy, endowment, investment-linked, life annuity plan, and medical and health purposes.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>General insurance</strong>is your protection from damages or losses excluded from the life insurance. Coverage period is yearly, so your payment is made on a single-basis only. Risks involved are: loss of your property in cases of thief, fire, and so on, payment for injury or damage the insured/policy holder has inflicted to a third party and your death or injury due to accident. Its main products comprise motor insurance, fire insurance, personal accident insurance, medical/health insurance and travel insurance.</p>

Since a definite sum must be paid, the element of investment is also present.   In other words, life insurance provides against pre-mature death and a fixed sum at the maturity of policy. At present, life insurance enjoys maximum scope because each and every person requires the insurance. Life insurance is a contract under which one person, in consideration of a premium paid either in lump sum or by monthly, quarterly, half yearly or yearly installments, undertakes to pay to the person (for whose benefits the insurance is made), a certain sum of money either on the death of the insured person or on the expiry of a specified period of time.

            <h3 id="one4"><Strong>Basic Concepts of Insurance</Strong></h3>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Proposer/Insured:</strong>  A proposer is a person or a firm who proposes for insurance cover to the insurance company.
              Once a proposal along with the premium is accepted by the insurance company a contract in to
              the form of a policy comes into existence. The proposal for insurance cannot be made by any
              person. A person who is the owner of a property or has a financial interest in the property can
              only propose for insurance. For example, in motor insurance only a registered owner of the
              vehicle or a bank/financier who has financed the vehicle can only propose for insurance.</p>
            <p align="justify"><Strong>Insurer/Insurance Company:</Strong> An individual or company who, through a contractual agreement, undertakes to compensate specified losses, liability, or damages incurred by another individual is known as the
              insurer/insurance company. An insurer is frequently an insurance company and is also known as
              an underwriter. An insurance company or the insurer in the Indian context is a duly registered
              Indian company to transact the general or life insurance business in India by the Government of
              India through its registering authority Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(IRDA).</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Beneficiary</strong>Beneficiary is the one whom the insured or policy holder has nominated for the insured amount in
              case of your death. Beneficiary are of two types: revocable beneficiary and irrevocable
              beneficiary. Revocable beneficiary’ designation gives right to the policy holder to change the
              beneficiary name without the consent of the named beneficiary. While in irrevocable beneficiary
              the policy holder has to take consent of the beneficiary before the name is changed.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Proposal Form</strong> Proposal form is the most important and basic document required for life insurance contract
              between the insured and insurance company This is a prescribed form required to be submitted
              duly signed and duly filled up along with the premium by the proposer proposing insurance to the
              office of the insurer directly or online or through its intermediaries like insurance agent or
              insurance broker. It includes the insured's fundamental information such as name, age, address,
              education, occupation, and so on. It also includes the person's medical history. Separate proposal
              forms are prescribed by the insurer for various types of insurance covers. Proposal form is the
              basis of insurance contract and concealment of material information or wrong information can
              lead to rejection of insurance claim.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Sum Insured</strong> Sum insured is the amount of money that an insurance company is obligated to cover in the event
              of a covered loss. It is the insurer's limit of liability under an insurance contract. Sum insured
              represents the sum for which insurance is required by the proposer and agreed by the insurer. It
              should represent the present market value of the subject matter of insurance. This is mentioned in
              the cover note and subsequently in the policy document by the insurer. The sum insured amount is
              dependent upon the premium price that is being paid for the insurance coverage. The sum insured
              is taken into consideration by insurer at the time of claim settlement.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Premium</strong>An insurance premium is the amount of money that an individual or business must pay for an
              insurance policy. Premium is an amount paid periodically to the insurer by the insured for
              covering his risk. The insurance premium is income for the insurance company, once it is earned,
              and also represents a liability in that the insurer must provide coverage for claims being made
              against the policy. The amount of premium varies and depends upon the premium rate, sum
              insured, subject matter of insurance, the perils covered, hazards involved, the past loss experience
              and terms and conditions of insurance. Premium can be paid by proposer or policy holder either
              by cash, cheque, bank draft, bank pay order, credit/debit card,Internet or e-transfer or direct credit
              through bank transfer or through bank guarantee or cash deposit.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Surrender Value and Paid Up Value</strong>Surrender value is the sum of money an insurance company pays to a policyholder in the event
              that his or her policy is voluntarily terminated before its maturity or an insured event occurs. The
              policy ceases as soon as the insured/policy holder withdraws the money, and the insured will lose
              out all the returns on it. A mid-term surrender would result in the policyholder getting a sum of
              what has been allocated towards savings and the earnings thereon. Paid-up value is the reduced
              amount of sum assured paid by the insurance company, in case the policyholder discontinues
              payment of premiums. After payment of three years of premium in traditional life insurance
              plans, your policy automatically acquires paid-up value. The sum assured by the insurance
              company is reduced proportionally depending when insured has stopped paying the premium.
              The insured or policy holder will get the amount at the end of the term.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong>No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a discount, given by an insurer to a policyholder for making no claims
              during the policy term. NCB can be accumulated over years and the discount ranges from 20
              percent to 50 percent on the own damage premium. No claim bonus is a benefit for those who
              have not claimed insurance during the preceding year of cover. This discount increases every
              year, provided, the claim has not been made yet. This will lower the premium on the following
              year. However, the discount rates are dependent on the age of the policy and when the last claim
              was made. NCB is applicable only on the own damage premium. It is not applicable on either the
              third-party liability premium or the add-on coverage.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance Coverage</strong>Insurance coverage means, when an individual takes an insurance policy the insured will be
              covered by insurance company for a specific amount for themselves or the things that he had
              taken the insurance policy, for which he would be paying premiums to the insurance company.
              The insurance company will pay the insured in case of damage or claims made by the insured
              according to their insurance coverage.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Policy</strong>Policy is a valid stamped document duly signed and issued by the authorised representative of the
              insurer as a proof of contract to the insured. It is generally an integrated contract, meaning that it
              includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and insurer. It contains
              schedule showing the name and address of insured and details of property insured. Policy also
              contains amount of premium paid, all the conditions, warranties and exclusions applicable to the
              contract besides the period of insurance with the date and time of commencement, and date and
              time of expiry, details of perils covered. In life insurance, policy also has a mention regarding
              name of nominee & date of maturity.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Premium Receipt</strong> It is a receipt of premium issued by the office of the insurer to the proposer/insured in token of
              having received the premium.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Certificate of Insurance</strong>A certificate of insurance is a document used to provide information on specific insurance
              coverage. The certificate provides verification of the insurance and usually contains information
              on types and limits of coverage, insurance company, policy number, named insured, and the
              policies’ effective periods. Although the certificate should not be substituted for information
              contained in the actual insurance policies, it is usually a reliable source of information or proof of
              insurance coverage. In motor insurance along with the policy an additional document is issued by
              the insurer as a proof of insurance of the vehicle, as required in the motor vehicles act and is
              known as certificate of insurance. This is required to be kept in person while driving the vehicle
              and is to be shown to the police authorities if asked for.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Cover Note</strong>A cover note is a temporary a numbered document issued by an insurance or a duly authorised
              representative pending issue of policy document to the insured in non-life insurance. A cover note
              is different from a certificate of insurance or an insurance policy document. A cover note features
              the name and address of the insured, the insurer, date and time of issue, period of cover, premium,
              and what is being covered by the insurance. It remains valid for the period of insurance until it is
              replaced by the policy document</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Endorsements</strong>Endorsements are the documents issued by the insurer after the issue of the policy to correct, add,
              delete, and make amendments in the policy at the instance of the insurer or the insured.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Contestable Period and Declaration Page</strong>Contestable period is usually 1 or 2 years, during which the insurance company holds all the rightto investigate the policy and decide whether to pay or not to pay to the insured. Declaration page’
              in insurance policy, bears all the information of the policy holder like name, address, vehicle
              information, type of coverage and loss payee information.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Claim</strong>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for
              a covered loss or policy event. In the event of claim under the policy, immediate intimation in
              writing by a letter is required to be given by insured to office of insurance company informing the
              policy number, name of insured, vehicle registration number (in case of motor insurance) date of
              accident, place of accident, nature of loss, cause of loss/damage. The insurance company validates
              the claim and, once approved, issues payment to the insured or an approved interested party on
              behalf of the insured. Insured should submit the duly completed and signed claim form,
              documents with a covering letter to insurance company and should always obtain
              acknowledgement from insurance company on photo copy of covering letter, for receipt of
              documents. If original documents are given to insurance company then a photo copy of claim
              form and all documents should be kept by insured for his record.<p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Renewal Notice</strong> Normally all the policies in general insurance are issued for a period of one year from the date of
              insurance except in the case of fire insurance of buildings used for residential purposes and some
              personal accident policies which can be issued on long term basis by the insurer. The date and
              time of expiry of the cover is mentioned in the policy and insurer is not liable for any untoward
              happening after the policy has lapsed. The insurers as a routine are not required to send the
              renewal notice to the insured in advance regarding the date of expiry of the policy, though
              insurance companies do send SMS and Email as a reminder for renewal of the existing policy. It
              is the duty of the insured to keep the track of his general insurance policies and arrange the
              renewal of the policy through the office of the insurer or his duly authorised representative by
              remitting the renewal premium before the expiry date positively if the insured wants to continue
              the cover.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk, Peril and Hazard</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">The words risk, peril, and hazard may seem interchangeable, but they have distinct definitions in
              the insurance and risk management world</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk</strong> Insurance replaces the uncertainty of risk with a guarantee that reduces the adverse effects of risk.
              Risk can be defined as the "uncertainty regarding a loss." Losses, such as auto damage due to an
              accident or negligence regarding your property, can give rise to a liability risk. The loss involved
              with these risks is the lessening or disappearance of value. Risk is the likelihood that an insured
              event will occur, requiring the insurer to pay a claim. For example, in life insurance, the insurance
              risk is the possibility that the insured party will die before his/her premiums equal or exceed the
              death benefit. Insurance companies compensate for this risk by adjusting premium according to
              how great the risk is. The process of analyzing exposures that create risk and designing programs
              to handle them is called risk management</p>
            <p align="justify">A risk that conforms to the norms and specifications of the insurance policy in such a way that the
              criterion for insurance is fulfilled is called insurable risk. There are various essential conditions
              that need to be fulfilled before acceptance of insurability of any risk. In order that a risk be
              insurable the following requirements must be met</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The loss to be insured against must be important enough to warrant the existence of an
                insurance contract</li>
              <li>Risk must permit a reasonable statistical estimate of the chance of loss in order to determine
                the amount of premium to be paid</li>
              <li>The loss should be definite as to cause, time, place and amount</li>
              <li>The loss is not catastrophic</li>
              <li>Risk is accidental in nature</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="justify">For example, the probability (or chance) that a certain vehicle will be involved in an accident in
              year2011 (out of the total vehicle insured that year 2011) can be determined from the number of
              vehicles that were involved in accidents in each of some previous years (out of the total vehicle
              insured those years). The probability (or chance) that a man (or woman) of a certain age will die
              in the ensuring year can be estimated by the fraction of people of that age that died in each of
              some previous. The insurance company also must be able to come up with a reasonable price for
              the insurance. In case of a scenario where the loss is too huge that no insurer would want to pay
              for it, the risk is said to be uninsurable. A risk may not be termed as insurable if it is
              immeasurable, very large, certain or not definable.</p>
            <p align="justify">A risk that cannot be insured, either because the probability of a loss is too high, or because it
              cannot be measured actuarially is uninsurable risk. Uninsurable risk is a condition that poses
              unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would be against the law. Insurance
              companies limit their losses by not taking on certain risks that are very likely to result in a loss.
              Uninsurable risks are those that would bring down an insurance pool, so they cannot be taken on
              for regular coverage. The basic concept of insurance is that it spreads risk among a large group of
              people, so they can protect against a large loss by making a small insurance payment. Insurance
              companies decline to take on non-insurable risks because they know they will almost certainly
              lose money very quickly if they do. In other words, assuming risk with such a high probability of
              loss is bad business. For example, a life insurance company may deem a person who is 70 years
              old and has lung cancer a non-insurable risk because the likelihood of their death before the
              policy becomes profitable is simply too high.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Prill</strong> Peril is a specific risk or cause of loss covered by an insurance policy. A peril is an event or
              circumstance that causes or may potentially cause a loss. Examples of perils include fire,
              flooding, hailstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, auto accidents, or home accidents, such as falling. A
              named-peril policy covers the policyholder only for the risks named in the policy in contrast to an
              all-risk policy, which covers all causes of loss except those specifically excluded</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Hazard</strong> Insurance hazard means the condition or situations that are likely to increases the chances of a
              loss arising from a peril. The probability of happening of the undesired event may become more
              certain or prominent if the subject-matter of insurance presents some peculiar characteristics
              facilitating the causation of the event. Sometimes the causation of the event may not be due to
              some peculiar characteristics of the subject matter itself but may be due to the peculiar character
              of the insured. Whatever it is, this hazard, in fact, indicates a danger (or risk), which danger
              influences the possible happening of the insured event, that is to say, which indicates the
              aggravation of the risk so as to make it somewhat different than normal. There are two elements
              to hazard that an insurers needs to carefully consider, that is, the physical hazard and the moral
              hazard. Both contribute to the chance of a loss.</p>
            <p align="justify">Moral hazards are concerned with the attitude and conduct of people. They indicate those dangers
              which relate to character, integrity and mental attitude of the insured. They are losses that result
              from dishonesty or indifference. Insurance companies suffer losses because of fraudulent or
              inflated claims. These are not visible and cannot be identified by mere inspection of the risk or
              subject of insurance. In every risk, an element of moral hazard may be to some degree, always
              present. For example, carelessness is the cause of most of the accidents and when the insured
              behaves carelessly, an unsatisfactory moral hazard is created; excessive over insurance is
              apparently an instance of bad moral hazard; a very unsatisfactory moral hazard exists when a
              person wants to take out a policy with the intent to make a profit.</p>
            <p align="justify">Physical Hazards are physical conditions that increase the possibility of a loss. They indicate the
              dangers of the subject of insurance which can be identified by inspection of the risk. Physical
              hazards indicate those dangers of the subject matter of insurance which can be ascertained or
              identified by mere inspection of the risk. The hazards are apparent in the subject- matter itself.
              The dangers are visible from the very nature, construction and situation of the subject-matter. For
              example, in motor insurance, the age, make, condition previous accidents, are all examples of
              physical hazard; in burglary insurance, the construction of the house, condition of doors and
              windows, existence or otherwise of burglar alarms, nature of contents, reputation or otherwise of
              the area are all examples of physical hazard; in personal accident insurance, physical hazard
              relates to age, occupation, health, physical condition and so on, of the proposer.</p>
            <p align="justify">Risk, peril, and hazard are terms used to indicate the possibility of loss, and are often used
              interchangeably, but the insurance industry distinguishes these terms. A risk is simply the
              possibility of a loss, but a peril is a cause of loss. A hazard is a condition that increases the
              possibility of loss. For instance, fire is a peril because it causes losses, while a fireplace is a
              hazard because it increases the probability of loss from fire. Some things can be both a peril and a
              hazard. Smoking, for instance, causes cancer and other health ailments, while also increasing the
              probability of such ailments.</p>

              <p><strong> KEY POINTS </strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management,
                  primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.</li>
                <li>There are two basic types of insurance – Life insurance and General Insurance. Life
                  Insurance pays the insured/policy holder or your beneficiaries a certain sum of money in
                  case of your death. General insurance is your protection from damages or losses excluded
                  from the life insurance.</li>
                <li>A proposer is a person or a firm who proposes for insurance cover to the insurance
                  company. Once a proposal along with the premium is accepted by the insurance company a
                  contract in to the form of a policy comes into existence.</li>
                <li>An individual or company who, through a contractual agreement, undertakes to
                  compensate specified losses, liability, or damages incurred by another individual is known
                  as the insurer/insurance company</li>
                <li>Beneficiary is the one whom the insured or policy holder has nominated for the insured
                  amount in case of your death. Beneficiary is of two types: revocable beneficiary and
                  irrevocable beneficiary</li>
                <li>Proposal form is a prescribed form required to be submitted duly signed and duly filled up
                  along with the premium by the proposer proposing insurance to the office of the insurer
                  directly or online or through its intermediaries like insurance agent or insurance broker.</li>
                <li>Insurance coverage means, when an individual takes an insurance policy the insured will
                  be covered by insurance company for a specific amount for themselves or the things that he
                  had taken the insurance policy, for which he would be paying premiums to the insurance
                  company.</li>
                <li>Sum insured is the amount of money that an insurance company is obligated to cover in the
                  event of a covered loss. It is the insurer's limit of liability under an insurance contract.
                  Premium is an amount paid periodically to the insurer by the insured for covering his risk.</li>
                <li>Surrender value is the sum of money an insurance company pays to a policyholder in the
                  event that his or her policy is voluntarily terminated before its maturity or an insured event
                  occurs. Paid-up value is the reduced amount of sum assured paid by the insurance
                  company, in case the policyholder discontinues payment of premiums</li>
                <li>No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a discount, given by an insurer to a policyholder for making no
                  claims during the policy term.</li>
                <li>Policy is a valid stamped document duly signed and issued by the authorised representative
                  of the insurer as a proof of contract to the insured. It is generally an integrated contract,
                  meaning that it includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and
                  insurer.</li>
                <li>A cover note is a temporary a numbered document issued by an insurance or a duly
                  authorized representative pending issue of policy document to the insured in non-life
                  insurance.</li>
                <li>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or
                  compensation for a covered loss or policy event. In the event of claim under the policy,
                  immediate intimation in writing by a letter is required to be given by insured to office of
                  insurance company informing the policy number, name of insured, vehicle registration
                  number (in case of motor insurance) date of accident, place of accident, nature of loss,
                  cause of loss/damage.</li>
                <li>In principle of utmost good faith, both parties involved in an insurance contract—the
                  insured (policy holder) and the insurer (the company)—should act in good faith towards
                  each other. The insurer and the insured must provide clear and concise information
                  regarding the terms and conditions of the contract.</li>
                <li>The principle of insurable interest states that the person getting insured must have insurable
                  interest in the object of insurance. A person has an insurable interest when the physical
                  existence of the insured object gives him some gain but its non-existence will give him a
                  loss.</li>
                <li>The principle of indemnity asserts that on the happening of a loss the insured shall be put
                  back into the same financial position as he used to occupy immediately before the loss. In
                  other words, the insured shall get neither more nor less than the actual amount of loss
                  sustained.</li>
                <li>Principle of Causa Proxima or Proximate (i.e. nearest) Cause, means when a loss is caused
                  by more than one causes, the proximate or the nearest or the closest cause should be taken
                  into consideration to decide the liability of the insurer.</li>
                <li>Principle of contribution states that the insured can claim the compensation only to the
                  extent of actual loss either from all insurers or from any one insurer.</li>
                <li>According to the principle of subrogation, when the insured is compensated for the losses
                  due to damage to his insured property, then the ownership right of such property shifts to
                  the insurer.</li>
                <li>The principle of loss minimisation states that the insured must always try his level best to
                  minimise the loss of his insured property, in case of uncertain events like a fire outbreak or
                  blast, and so on.</li>
                <li>Risk is the likelihood that an insured event will occur, requiring the insurer to pay a claim.
                  A risk that conforms to the norms and specifications of the insurance policy in such a way
                  that the criterion for insurance is fulfilled is called insurable risk. Uninsurable risk is a
                  condition that poses unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would
                  be against the law.</li>
                <li>Peril is a specific risk or cause of loss covered by an insurance policy. A peril is an event
                  or circumstance that causes or may potentially cause a loss.</li>
                <li>Insurance hazard means the condition or situations that are likely to increases the chances
                  of a loss arising from a peril. The probability of happening of the undesired event may
                  become more certain or prominent if the subject-matter of insurance presents some peculiar
                  characteristics facilitating the causation of the event.</li>
                <li>Moral hazards are concerned with the attitude and conduct of people. They indicate those
                  dangers which relate to character, integrity and mental attitude of the insured. Physical
                  hazards are physical conditions that increase the possibility of a loss. They indicate the
                  dangers of the subject of insurance which can be identified by inspection of the risk.</li>

            <h3 id="two2">Insurers or Insurance Companies</h3>

            <p align="justify">Insurance companies lead to economic development by mobilizing savings and investing them
              into productive activities. Indian insurance companies are able to mobilize long-term savings to
              support economic growth and also facilitate economic development by providing insurance cover
              to a large segment of our people as well as to business enterprise throughout India. Role of
              insurance companies in economic development of India</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Capital Formation and Insurance:</strong> The contribution of insurance companies in the process of
              capital formation appears at all these stages. Insurance services act as a tool to mobilize saving,
              function as financial intermediary and at times also indulge in direct investment. Also govt. has
              made regulations under which every insurer carrying on business of life insurance shall invest
              25% of funds in Govt. securities and not less than 15% in infrastructure and social sector.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Encouraging Financial Stability and Reducing Anxiety:</strong> Insurer promotes financial stability in
              economy by insuring the risks and losses of individuals, firm and organizations. Because of
              uninsured large losses, firm may not be able to compensate for it leading to its insolvency which
              may cause loss of employment, revenue to supplier & Govt., loss of products to customer, etc.
              Moreover, it relieves the tensions and anxiety of individuals by securing the loss of their lives and
              assets.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance as Financial Intermediary:</strong>The insurance companies perform extremely useful
              function in economy as financial intermediaries. Insurers help in reducing transaction cost in
              economy by collecting funds from policyholders and investing the same in different projects
              scattered over different regions. It is a specialized and time consuming job. The policyholders, in
              case of loss, are not required to wait for a long period for the amount of claim. It improves their
              liquidity. Insurers are in the position of financing large projects, railways power projects, etc.
              These large projects create economies of scale, facilitate technological innovation and
              specialization and thus promote economic efficiency and productivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Obligation to Rural and Social Sector:</strong> In India, the insurance companies are required to fulfill
              their obligation towards rural and social sector. For this, Life insurers are required to have 5%,
              7%, 10%, 12%, and 15% of total policies in first five years respectively in rural sector. Likewise
              General Insurers are required to have 2% 3% and 5% thereafter of total gross premium income
              written in first five financial years respectively in rural sector.</p>
            <p><strong>Promotes Trade and Commerce:</strong>The increase in GDP is positively correlated to growth of
              trade and commerce in economy. Whether it is production of goods and services, domestic or
              international trade or venture capital projects, insurance dominates everywhere. Even banks
              demand insurance cover of assets while granting loans for purchase of assets. Thus insurance
              covers, promotes specialization and flexibility in the economic system that play contributory role
              in healthy and smooth growth of trade and commerce.</p>
            <p><strong>Reducing Burden on Government Exchequer:</strong>Insurance companies, particularly life insurers
              provide a variety of insurance products covering needs of children, women and aged etc under
              social security network and thereby reduce the burden on Govt. exchequer in providing these
              services. This Govt., saves expenditure on these items and amount can be utilized for more
              productive projects. To conclude, we can say that insurance companies play an important role in
              economic development of country.</p>
            <p><strong>Saving and Insurance:</strong>Insurance companies lead to economic development by mobilizing
              savings and investing them into productive activities. Indian insurance companies are able to
              mobilize long-term savings to support economic growth and also facilitate economic development
              by providing insurance cover to a large segment of our people as well as to business enterprise
              throughout India.</p>
            <p><strong>Insurers/Insurance Companies in India</strong></p>
            <p>The insurance industry of India consists of 57 insurance companies of which 24 are in life
              insurance business and 33 are non-life insurers. Among the life insurers, Life Insurance
              Corporation (LIC) is the sole public sector company. Apart from that, among the non-life insurers
              there are six public sector insurers. In addition to these, there is sole national re-insurer, namely,
              General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC Re). Other stakeholders in Indian Insurance market
              include agents (individual and corporate), brokers, surveyors and third party administrators
              servicing health insurance claims. Out of 33 non-life insurance companies, five private sector
              insurers are registered to underwrite policies exclusively in health, personal accident and travel
              insurance segments. They are Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Ltd, Apollo Munich
              Health Insurance Company Ltd, Max Bupa Health Insurance Company Ltd, Religare Health
              Insurance Company Ltd and Cigna TTK Health Insurance Company Ltd. There are two more
              specialized insurers belonging to public sector, namely, Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of
              India for Credit Insurance and Agriculture Insurance Company Ltd for crop insurance.</p>
            <p>Life insurance companies offer coverage to the life of the individuals, whereas the non-life
              insurance companies offer coverage with our day-to-day living like travel, health, our car and
              bikes, and home insurance. Not only this, but the non-life insurance companies provide coverage
              for our industrial equipment’s as well. Crop insurance for our farmers, gadget insurance for
              mobiles, pet insurance etc. are some more insurance products being made available by the general
              insurance companies in India. The life insurance companies have gained an investment prospectus
              in the recent times with an idea of providing insurance along with a growth of your savings. But,
              the general insurance companies remain reluctant to offer pure risk cover to the individuals.</p>
            <h3 id="two3">Insurance Intermediaries</h3>
            <p>An insurance intermediary acts either on behalf of the client or the insurance company. Insurance
              intermediaries have been defined in the IRDAI Act, 1999 and section2 (1) (f) of the act states:
              Insurance intermediaries serve as a bridge between consumers and insurance companies, and
              includes individual agents, corporate agents including banks and brokers, insurance marketing
              firm. Insurance intermediary also includes surveyors and third party administrators but these
              intermediaries are not involved in procurement of business. Surveyors assess losses on behalf of
              the insurance companies. Third party administrators provide services related to health insurance
              for insurance companies through the insurance sector has been privatized the insurers can deal
              with intermediaries only if they are holding valid license issued by the authority and the authority
              has laid down the norms for licensing of intermediaries</p>
            <p>Traditionally, insurance intermediaries have been categorized as either insurance agents or
              insurance brokers. The distinction between the two relates to the manner in which they function in
              the marketplace. The role of insurance intermediaries in the overall economy is, essentially, one
              of making insurance – and other risk management products – widely available, thereby increasing
              the positive effects of insurance generally – risk-taking, investment, provision of basic societal
              needs and economic growth. There are several factors that intermediaries bring to the insurance
              marketplace that help to increase the availability of insurance generally:</p>
            <p><strong>Dissemination of Information to Consumers:</strong> Intermediaries provide customers with the
              necessary information required to make educated purchases/ informed decisions. Intermediaries
              can explain what a consumer needs, and what the options are in terms of insurers, policies and
              prices. Faced with a knowledgeable client base that has multiple choices, insurers will offer
              policies that fit their customers’ needs at competitive prices.</p>
            <p><strong>Dissemination of Information to the Marketplace:</strong>Intermediaries gather and evaluate
              information regarding placements, premiums and claims experience. When such knowledge is
              combined with an intermediary’s understanding of the needs of its clients, the intermediary is
              well-positioned to encourage and assist in the development of new and innovative insurance
              products and to create markets where none have existed. In addition, dissemination of knowledge
              and expansion of markets within a country and internationally can help to attract more direct
              investment for the insurance sector and related industries.</p>
            <p><strong>Innovative Marketing:</strong>Insurance intermediaries bring innovative marketing practices to the
              insurance marketplace. This deepens and broadens insurance markets by increasing consumers’
              awareness of the protections offered by insurance, their awareness of the multitude of insurance
              options, and their understanding as to how to purchase the insurance they need.</p>
            <h3 id="two4">Insurance Brokers</h3>
            <p>An insurance broker is seen as one of the intermediaries who operate in the insurance market. In
              the Indian context, the insurance broker is a person who will represent the insured and add value
              to the transaction. An insurance broker is a professional who offers, negotiates, and sells policies.
              He acts as intermediary between insurers and customers and receives compensation. An
              important role of brokers is to help insurers to assess the types of risks they face. At the same
              time, brokers act on behalf of and in the interest of customers. They do comparison shopping to
              find the best deals and offer policies from more than one insurance company. Brokers also help
              their clients to outline risk management strategies, which are suitable for their profile. Insurance
              brokers consult clients and gather information for them. This is important as to understand their
              specific needs. Brokers help individuals and businesses to find the right accident, health, life,
              casualty, and property insurance. They offer a wide array of services such as claims assistance,
              consulting services, and resolving benefit issues. They also help clients to stay updated on
              legislative and regulatory changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong>
              The role and responsibilities of the insurance broker has multiplied in the sense that he not only
              has to get the right price for the insured to enable him to take informed decision to select the right
              underwriter, but he also has a duty towards the underwriter to ensure that all parameters of rating
              a risk have been rightly applied. This is only to ensure that a clear balance is maintained so that
              one does not impinge on the other in the event of a catastrophe. They negotiate with insurance
              companies to be able to offer the best terms and premiums to clients. In addition, they help clients
              to mitigate risks and come up with working risk management strategies. In addition to advising
              clients, brokers handle policy renewals and amend policies, if required. They maintain
              relationships with engineers, photographers, surveyors, financial institutions, and insurance
              companies. Thus they can act on behalf of clients and deal with administrative tasks such as
              correspondence with insurers and other professionals, paperwork, etc.</p>
            <p>The functions of a broker shall include any one or more of the following.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acting promptly on instructions from a client and providing him written acknowledgements and progress reports.</li>
              <li>Assisting clients in paying premium under section 64VB of Insurance Act, 1938 (4 of 1938).</li>
              <li>Assisting in the negotiation of the claims and familiarizing himself with the client's business and underwriting information so that this can be explained to an insurer and others.</li>
              <li>Maintaining detailed knowledge of available insurance markets, as may be applicable.</li>
              <li>Maintaining proper records of claims.</li>
              <li>Obtaining detailed information of the client's business and risk management philosophy.</li>
              <li>Providing requisite underwriting information as required by an insurer in assessing the risk to decide pricing terms and conditions for cover.</li>
              <li>Providing services related to insurance consultancy and risk management.</li>
              <li>Rendering advice on appropriate insurance cover and terms.</li>
              <li>Submitting quotation received from insurer/s for consideration of a client.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Degrees and certificates requirements for brokers would depend on the country or state ofresidence. Without a degree, brokers usually hold an administrative or support position until theygain experience. Successful brokers have good interpersonal, communication, and written skills.
              They negotiate with and consult insurers and customers and should be able to develop andmaintain relationships with different professionals. They also have business acumen, IT andadministrative skills, as well as customer service skills. Brokers read specialist journals and press to stay updated and attend seminars. Brokerages usually offer training in legal and insuranceissues, and there are other training schemes. Individuals who seek to become insurance brokers should have a clean background. Misdemeanors and offences reduce one’s chances of becoming one.</p>
            <p><strong>Categories of Insurance Brokers</strong></p>
            <p>IRDA has permitted 3 types of Brokers to operate in India:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Direct Broker (between end-users and primary insurers only) </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Direct (Life Insurance)</li>
            <li>Direct (General Insurance)</li>
            <li>Direct (Life and General Insurance)</li>
            <li>Re-insurance Brokers (between primary insurers and re-insurers only) and</li>
            <li> Composite Brokers (both the above).</li>
            <p><strong>Direct Broker</strong>Direct broker means an insurance broker who for the time-being licensed by the Authority to act
              as such, for a remuneration carries out the functions as specified under regulation 3 either in the
              field of life insurance or general insurance or both on behalf of his clients. Life insurance brokers
              are instrumental in assessing needs and establishing the type of life insurance most suitable to
              address those needs. Life insurance brokers search the market on your behalf, helping secure the
              most suitable cover, at the most affordable price possible. General Insurance brokers sell non-life
              insurances. There are two types of general insurance brokers who specialises in different covers
              and policies. Retail general insurance brokers are professionals who act on behalf of companies
              and individuals. They offer policies such as health, travel, home, and car insurance, along with
              private and public liability and employer’s liability plans. Commercial general insurance brokers
              specialise in areas such as gas, oil, marine, and aviation and offer complex and high value
              policies. Commercial insurance policies cover equipment, machinery, and real estate in the event
              of theft or damage.</p>

            <p><strong>Reinsurance Broker</strong></p>
            <p>A reinsurance broker is a person who acts as an intermediary between an insurance company and
              a reinsurance company. Reinsurance brokers work for the insurance company and their job is to
              acquire reinsurance for it. This can involve negotiating rates and finding the best policies. Many
              insurance companies use reinsurance brokers because the process of purchasing reinsurance can
              be complicated. They rely on reinsurance brokers' specialized skills to help them get the best
              deals possible. After all, reinsurance policies will only really help insurance companies if they
              provide adequate coverage at reasonable rates. Otherwise, the companies could be paying too
              much for too little protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Functions of a Reinsurance Broker</strong></p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Composite Insurance Broker</strong></p>
            <p>Composite broker means an insurance broker who for the time-being registered by the Authority to act as such, for a remuneration or fee,arranges insurance for its clients with insurers and/orreinsurance for its client/s with insurers and reinsurers located in India and abroad. A composite
              broker shall carry out any one or more of the functions mentioned for a direct brokers and reinsurance broker</p>
            <h3 id="two5"><strong>Insurance Agents</strong></h3>
            <p>An insurance agent’s role is primarily that of a communicator, counselor and facilitator. The
              prospective customer can buy the best insurance products and services for his/her varied
              requirements viz. life, property, health, burglary insurance from the insurance agent. An agent is a
              primary source for procurement of insurance business and as such his role is the corner stone for
              building a solid edifice of any life insurance organization. An agent must be equipped with
              technical aspects of insurance knowledge, he must possess analytical ability to analyze customers’
              need, he must be abreast with up to date knowledge of merits or demerits of other instruments of
              investment available in the financial market, he must be endowed with a burning desire of social
              service and over and above all this, he must possess and develop an undeterred determination to
              succeed as an insurance salesman. In short he must be an agent with professional approach in
              insurance salesmanship. Such an agency force is expected to be helpful not only in proper field
              underwriting but also after sales servicing, concomitant and essential elements for higher
              retention of business.</p>
            <p>Agents and brokers act as intermediaries between the insurance buyer and the insurers. Each has a
              legal duty to help you obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable price. Each must have a license
              to distribute the type of insurance he or she is selling. An agent or broker must also adhere to the
              regulations enforced by your state insurance department. The main difference between a broker
              and an agent has to do with whom they represent. An agent represents one or more insurance
              companies. He or she acts as an extension of the insurer. A broker, on the other hand, represents
              the insurance buyer.</p>
            <h3 id="two6">Point of Sales Person(s) (POS) Persons</h3>
            <p>IRDAI has also permitted distribution of life insurance through corporate agents and brokers.
              Some of the NBFCs, who have a network of branches and customer base became corporate agents
              and offered life insurance products along with their core products. Brokers are specialist entities,
              who represent the interest of the customers and can work with multiple life insurers. Despite of all
              these channels of distribution, the insurance penetration of India continues to be low; indicating a
              large section of the population is still uninsured or underinsured. IRDAI, regulator for the
              industry has been proactive and continuously engages with the industry in development of
              distribution of life insurance products, while ensuring the protection of consumer interest. One
              such new initiative of IRDAI is the Point of Sale (POS) person for distributing insurance
              products. IRDAI has allowed POS person to sell basic insurance products to increase insurance
              penetration in the country. This is a newer channel for distributing of insurance products and
              IRDAI has issued guidelines for POS’P and also on products that can be offered through this POS
              channel.</p>
            <p>The POS person can sell only simple and easy to understand products wherein each and every
              benefit under the product is predefined and disclosed upfront clearly to the customer. POS can
              solicit and market only certain pre-underwritten products approved by the authority. The POS can
              sell comprehensive motor insurance, third-party liability, personal accident cover, travel insurance
              policy, home insurance policy and any other policy specifically approved by Irdai. Every policy
              sold through POS will be separately identified and pre-fixed by the name POS. The insurer will
              have to file the product with the regulator under the file-use guidelines for information. POS
              model will help the insurers to increase the breadth and depth of their distribution capability and it
              is expected that POS will make significant contribution in distributing insurance in the coming
              years. As far as the customers are concerned, POS will make insurance available at a place closer
              to them and also help in better servicing capability. Since the products offered through POS are
              easy to understand with clearly defined benefits, the scope for mis-sale has been substantially
              minimized.</p>
            <p>Any individual aged above 18 years with 10th standard pass qualification can become a POS
              person and has to undergo a simplified training and pass the examination. Every POS will be
              identified by the Aadhaar Card Number or his PAN Card. IRDA has dispensed mandatory
              training and certification for point of sales person. Earlier, it was mandatory to take training and
              certificate from the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology. The persons
              soliciting and marketing such pre-underwritten products approved by the authority as POS will
              have to be at least a matriculate. The POS will be made liable to a penalty as per the provisions of
              Section 102 of the Act. Wherever sales are done through the insurance intermediary, the latter
              will record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN of the POS in the proposal form. Also, the POS
              when engaged by the insurer, POS will place business with that insurer subject to compliance of
              rules and procedures of that insurance company</p>

            <h2 id="three">PRINICPLES AND PRACTISE OF INSURANCE</h2>
            <p>Insurance may be defined as a contract between two parties whereby one party called insurer undertakes in exchange for a fixed sum called premium to pay the other party called insured a fixed amount of money after happening of a certain event. Insurance policy is a legal contract and its formation is subject to the fulfillment of the requisites of a contract defined under Indian Contract Act 1872. According to the Act “A Contract may be defined as an agreement between two or more parties to do or to abstain from doing an act, with an intention to create a legally binding relationship. Since Insurance is a contract, certain sections of Indian Contract Act are applicable. Insurance, like every other contract, is formed when there is an offer made, that offer is accepted, and consideration (payment or a promise to pay premium) is given.</p>
            <p>The insurance contract involves—(A) the elements of the general contract, and (B) the element of special contract relating to insurance.</p>
            <p>The special contract of insurance involves principles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Insurable Interest.</li>
              <li>Utmost Good Faith.</li>
              <li>Indemnity.</li>
              <li>Subrogation.</li>
              <li>Warranties.</li>
              <li>Proximate Cause.</li>
              <li>Assignment and Nomination.</li>
              <li>Return of Premium</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The valid contract, according to Section 10 of Indian Contract Act 1872, must have the following essentialities</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Agreement (offer and acceptance),</li>
              <li>Legal consideration,</li>
              <li>Competent to make a contract,</li>
              <li>Free consent,</li>
              <li>Legal object.</li>
              <li>Writing and Registration</li>
              <li>Possibility of Performance</li>
              <li>Certainty and</li>
              <li>Agreement not declared void</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three1">Offer (Proposal) and Acceptance</h3>
            <P>The offer for entering into the contract may come from the insured. The insurer may also propose to make the contract. Whether the offer is from the side of an insurer or from the side of insured, the main fact is acceptance. Any act that precedes it is the offer or a counter-offer. All that preceded the offerer counter-offer is an invitation to offer. In insurance, the publication of the prospectus, the canvassing of the agents are invitations to offer. Generally, the acceptance of the offer must be communicated to the offerer, unless the offerer waives this requirement. It may be possible to infer acceptance from conduct, such as where the insured pays, or the insurers accept, the premium. If the offer is made by the insurer, the communication of an acceptance to a third party, such as a broker, is insufficient unless the broker is the agent of the insurer, which is not usually the case.</P>
            <P>The acceptance must match the offer and be unconditional, otherwise it may be regarded as a counter offer, which will be a rejection of the original offer and will begin the whole process over again. When the prospect (the potential policy-holder) proposes to enter the contract, it is an offer and if there is any alteration in the offer that would be a counter-offer. If this alteration or change (counter-offer) ill-accepted by the proposer, it would be acceptable. In the absence of counter-offer, the acceptance of the offer will be an acceptance by the insurer. At the moment, the notice of acceptance is given to another party; it would be a valid acceptance. For example, where in response to a proposal by the prospective insured the insurer sends out a policy that includes a term of which the prospective insured was previously unaware, this might constitute a counter-offer. On the other hand, where the insurer responds with a policy in standard form, then as long as it is not inconsistent with the proposal, it may be held to be a valid acceptance even though it includes terms not expressly communicated, if the insured could reasonably be expected to know that there would be such terms.</P>
            <P>It is a general principle of contract law that once an offer has been accepted and an agreement formed neither party may unilaterally withdraw. The contract may, of course, give the parties the right to cancel the contract. Where a policy contains a term allowing cancellation by the insurer, it will usually also provide for a portion of the premium to be repaid to the insured. It is common for an agreement on insurance to specify that either the contract is not binding or, alternatively, that the contract is binding but the risk does not commence, until a specified requirement is met, such as the payment of the premium or the completion of a satisfactory medical examination</P>
            <P>For example, in life insurance an offer can be made either by the insurance company or the applicant (proposer) and the acceptance will follow.</P><P>For instance,</P>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>An offer made by the Insurance company to proposer that the premium amount will be INR.500/- per annum for the Insurance amount of INR.5000/-. It is for the proposer toaccept the offer or not</li>
              <li>An advertisement in the newspaper about the availability of different life Insurance policies is an invitation for an offer. If a proposer makes an application, then it will be offer from the applicant and the insurance company may or may not accept it.</li>
              <li>An offer may be considered accepted either when the insurance company issues the policy or the first premium is paid by the applicant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As stated above in example (a) if the applicant pays the first premium of INR 500/- to the insurance company then the contract is completed as both the parties have accepted the offer. Similarly, if the company issues the policy in above stated example (b) then the offer is accepted by the insurance company and the contract is completed.</p>
            <p>The offer or proposal and its acceptance may be verbal or in writing but in insurance contracts these are in writing. In general insurance the insured offers to purchase an insurance from the insurer and this offer is in the form of a proposal form and the insurer after studying the proposal can either reject the proposal or accept it. In case he accepts he issues a cover note or a letter of acceptance. In the latter event the acceptance letter becomes a counter offer or proposal, which is accepted on payment of premium by the insured.</p>
            <h3 id="three2">Consideration (Premium)</h3>
            <p>A consideration is an exchange of money for the guarantee of an act preformed or another benefit provided. For a contract to be binding each party to the contract must give what is known as consideration or the exchange of values on which a contract is based. In an insurance contract, the insured person makes a premium payment (consideration now) and promises to comply with the provisions of the policy (consideration future). In return, the insurance company promises to pay in accordance with the terms of the contract. The premium will be set by the insurers at a level that attracts business, but that also both reflects the risk of a claim by this insured and, across the business as a whole, is likely to result in a profit. The premium will be payable either in a single sum or, more typically in consumer cases, by installments on credit terms. Even where the premium is payable by installments, it is still a single premium for the entire period, so that if the risk is terminated the outstanding installments will still have to be paid on the principle that the risk is not divisible unless the parties have agreed to the contrary. The premium is an important aspect of the agreement, and if one has not been agreed by the parties this may indicate that they have not concluded a contract</p>
            <h3 id="three3">Competent to make a Contract</h3>
            <p>Another essential element for a contract is that the parties to the contract must be competent parties, or of undiminished mental capacity. Most people are competent to contract, but there are exceptions. A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. A person who is usually of unsound mind, but, occasionally of sound mind may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A contract made by incompetent party/parties will be void. If a contract is made with a minor the application may be held unenforceable if the minor decides to repudiate it at a later date. In insurance contract the insurer is bound by the contract as long as the underage wishes to continue it. If the minor repudiates his contract, the law will allow him a refund of all premium paid. Insanity or mental incompetence precludes the making of a valid insurance contract.</p>
            <h3 id="three4">Free Consent</h3>
            <p>Parties entering into the contract should enter into it by their free consent. The consent will be free when it is not caused by, coercion, mistake, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Both parties to the contract should be of the same mind and there must be consent arising out of common intention. Both parties should be clear about what the other is saying. The Insurer should know what the insured wants, and the insured should know what the insurer is offering, and both should be agreed on this. The proposal for free consent must sign a declaration to this effect, the person explaining the subject matter of the proposal to the proposer must also accordingly make a written declaration or the proposal. When there is no free consent except fraud, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. In case of fraud, the contract would be void.</p>
            <p>Factors which invalidate free consent</p>
            <p><Strong>Coercion: </Strong>Coercion’ is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.</p>
            <p><Strong>Undue Influence: </Strong>When the parties to the contract are in relationships in such a way that one party can dominate the will of the other and uses the unfair advantage so gained to obtain the consent of the other party, then the consent is said to have been obtained by undue influence.  Now, the Contract Act 1872 also provides instances where a person can dominate the will of another</p>
            <p><strong>Fraud: </strong>Consent is not said to be free when it has been obtained by means of fraud. In such cases, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by means of fraud. Moreover, fraud is also a tort where action for damages can lie. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 gives the definition of the term ‘Fraud’.  The law provides five acts which when committed either by the party or with his assistance or by his agent, with the intention to deceive the other party, amounts to fraud.</p>
            <p><strong>Misrepresentation: </strong>Misrepresentation under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 has an exhaustive definition and can be divided into 3 types.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first type is when a statement is made by a person, about a fact which is not true, though he believes it to be true. </li>
              <li>Second is the type when there is a breach of duty by a person who is making the false statement and he gains some kind of advantage even though it wasn’t his intention to deceive the other party. </li>
              <li>The third is the type where if one party acting innocently, causes the other party to make any mistake with regards to the subject matter of the agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Mistake: </strong>When one of the parties has given its consent to the contract under some kind of misunderstanding then the consent is said to be have been given by mistake. If it wasn’t for the misunderstanding the party would not have entered into the agreement.</p>
            <h3 id="three5">Legal Purpose</h3>
            <p>A contract must have a legal purpose-that is, it must not be for the performance of an activity prohibited by law, immoral, opposed to public policy, and which defeat the provisions of any law. If it does not, enforcing the contract would be contrary to public policy. In the proposal from the object of insurance is asked which should be legal and the object should not be concealed. If the object of insurance, like the consideration, is found to be unlawful, the policy is void.
              Contracts may be either oral or written; they must, however, follow a specific legal form, or appropriate language.</p>
            <h3 id="three6">Principles of Insurance </h3>
            <p>The main objective of every insurance contract is to give financial security and protection to the insured from any future uncertainties. The principles of insurance are the rule of action or conduct adopted by the participants involved in the insurance business. The specific principles of a valid insurance contract consist of the following.</p>
            <p><strong>Utmost Good Faith   (Uberrimae Fidei)</strong></p>
            <p>Under this principle, both parties involved in an insurance contract—the insured (policy holder) and the insurer (the company)—should act in good faith towards each other. The insurer and the insured must provide clear and concise information regarding the terms and conditions of the contract. This is a very basic and primary principle of insurance contracts because the nature of the service is for the insurance company to provide a certain level of security and solidarity to the insured person’s life. However, the insurance company must also watch out for anyone looking for a way to scam them into free money. So each party is expected to act in good faith towards each other. If the insurance company provides the insured/policy holder with falsified or misrepresented information, then they are liable in situations where this misrepresentation or falsification has caused the insured/policyholder loss. If the insured/policy holder have misrepresented information regarding subject matter or your own personal history, then the insurance company’s liability becomes void (revoked).</p>
            <p><strong>Insurable Interest</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of insurable interest states that the person getting insured must have insurable interest in the object of insurance. A person has an insurable interest when the physical existence of the insured object gives him some gain, but its non-existence will give him a loss. In simple words, the insured person must suffer some financial loss by the damage of the insured object. It means that the subject matter of the contract must provide some financial gain by existing for the insured (or policyholder) and would lead to a financial loss if damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. The owner of the subject is said to have an insurable interest until he/she is no longer the owner.</p>
            <p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of indemnity asserts that on the happening of a loss the insured shall be put back into the same financial position as he used to occupy immediately before the loss. In other words, the insured shall get neither more nor less than the actual amount of loss sustained. This, of course, is always subject to the limit of the sum insured and also subject to certain terms and conditions of the policy. In general insurance contracts principle of indemnity is applicable which says that insured would be compensated only the actual loss suffered by him at the time of accident and not more. Hence to arrive at the actual loss firstly the market value of the property on the date of accident is ascertained and then the sum insured or market value whichever is less is paid subject to policy conditions and completion of the formalities required for settlement of claim. Life insurance and personal accident insurance policies are the exception where the principle of indemnity does not apply and sum insured as mentioned in the policy is paid at the time of an admissible claim. For example, A house is insured against fire for Rs. 50000. It is burnt down and found that the expenditure of Rs. 30000 will restore it to its original condition. The insurer is liable to pay only Rs. 30000. In life insurance, principle of indemnity does not apply as there is no question of actual loss. The insurer is required to pay a fixed amount upon in advance in the event of accident, death or at the expiry of the fixed term of the policy. Thus, a contract of a life insurance is a contingent contract and not a contract of indemnity.</p>
            <p><strong>Proximate Cause (Causa Proxima)</strong></p>
            <p>Principle of Causa Proxima or Proximate (i.e. nearest) Cause, means when a loss is caused by more than one causes, the proximate or the nearest or the closest cause should be taken into consideration to decide the liability of the insurer. The principle states that to find out whether the insurer is liable for the loss or not, the proximate and not the remote must be looked into. That is the loss of insured property can be caused by more than one incident even in succession to each other.  Property may be insured against some but not all causes of loss, and when a property is not insured against all causes, the nearest cause is to be found out.  If the proximate cause is one in which the property is insured against, then the insurer must pay compensation. If it is not a cause the property is insured against, then the insurer does not have to pay. For example In a marine insurance policy, the goods were insured against damage by sea water, some rats on the board made a hole in a bottom of the ship causing sea water to pour into the ship and damage the goods. Here, the proximate cause of loss is sea water which is covered by the policy and the hole made by the rats is a remote cause. Therefore, the insured can recover damage from the insurer</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution </strong></p>
            <p>Principle of contribution is a corollary of the principle of indemnity. It applies to all contracts of indemnity, if the insured has taken out more than one policy on the same subject matter. According to this principle, the insured can claim the compensation only to the extent of actual loss either from all insurers or from any one insurer. If one insurer pays full compensation then that insurer can claim proportionate claim from the other insurers. As per this principle applicable to the general insurance policies, if the insured has more than one policy for the same property of the same value and if the loss is suffered due to damage to such property then the loss is shared and contributed between all the insurers in equal proportions or as per the proportion of the sum insured or as mentioned in the policy. The principle of contribution further strengthens the principle of indemnity applicable in general insurance contracts. This principle is not applicable in life and personal accident insurance. For example, A gets his property insured against fire for Rs. 10000 with insurer P and for Rs. 20000 with insurer Q. a loss of Rs. 15000 occurs, P is liable to pay for Rs. 5000 and Q is labile to pay Rs 10000. If the whole amount of loss is paid by Q, then Q can recover Rs. 5000 from P. The liability of P and Q will be determined as under:</p>
            <p>Sum insured with Individual insurer (i.e. P or Q) x Actual Loss  = Total sum insured</p>
            <p>Liability of P = 10000   x 15000              = Rs.5000/30000</p>
            <p>Liability of Q = 20000   x 15000        		 = Rs.10000/30000</p>
            <p>The right of contribution arises when</p>
            <ol type ="i">
              <li> There are different policies which related to the same subject matters;</li>
              <li> The policies cover the same period which caused the loss;</li>
              <li> All the policies are in force at the time of loss; and</li>
              <li> One of the insurer has paid to the insured more than his share of loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Subrogation </strong></p>
            <p>Principle of subrogation is an extension and another corollary of the principle of indemnity. It also applies to all contracts of indemnity.  According to the principle of subrogation, when the insured is compensated for the losses due to damage to his insured property, then the ownership right of such property shifts to the insurer. This principle is applicable only when the damaged property has any value after the event causing the damage. The insurer can benefit out of subrogation rights only to the extent of the amount he has paid to the insured as compensation. For example in marine cargo policies, in the transit by railways, after having paid the claim for the loss suffered by the insured due to damage or loss of insured goods, due to the subrogation rights the insurer become entitled to receive the claim amount from the railway authorities. The application of principle of subrogation is required to follow the rule of indemnity in general insurance contracts only and not in life or personal accident insurance policies. For example: Furniture is insured for Rs. 1 LAC against fire, it is burnt down and the insurer pays the full value of Rs. 1 LAC to the insured, later on the damage Furniture is sold for Rs. 10,000. The insurer is entitled to receive the sum of Rs. 10,000.</p>
            <p><strong>Loss of Minimisation </strong></p>
            <p>According to the principle of loss minimisation, insured must always try his level best to minimize the loss of his insured property, in case of uncertain events like a fire outbreak or blast, and so on. The insured must take all possible measures and necessary steps to control and reduce the losses in such a scenario. The insured must not neglect and behave irresponsibly during such events just because the property is insured. It is the main responsibility of the insured to act diligently and take all steps to cut losses to the insured property. For example, If a house is insured against fire, and there is accidental fire, the owner must take all reasonable steps to keep the loss minimum. He is supposed to take all steps which a man of ordinary prudence will take under the circumstances to save the insured property.</p>
            <h3 id="three7">Proposal Form</h3>
            <p>Proposal form is the most important and basic document required for an insurance contract between the insured and insurance company. It includes the insured's fundamental information such as address, age, name, education, occupation and so on. It also includes the person's medical history.  An insurance company offers a policy on the basis of a proposal form. The form is the most basic requirement for the functioning of the insurance contract between the insured and the insurance company. It needs to be completed by the proposer who may seek the assistance of a life insurance advisor to fill it up.When purchasing insurance, it is necessary for the prospect to provide the insurer with information so that it can assess the risk. When purchasing insurance, it is necessary for the prospect to provide the insurer with information so that it can assess the risk. This is usually done by filling in a proposal form, often available from agents, brokers, or insurers. Proposal forms are questionnaires issued by the insurer to be completed by the proposer or his/her agent, which ask questions about the subject matter of cover. A proposal form seeks basic information of the proposer and the assured. The proposer has to mention his/her income in the proposal form to satisfy the insurer about his/her ability to pay for the insurance and the need for insurance, respectively. Proposal form helps the insurance company to calculate all the potential risks in relation to the insurance policy and hence deciding the premium amount. Since the insurer will use the information to assess a premium and set the terms and conditions of the policy, the prospective insured must disclose all the material circumstances, whether or not the proposal form asks for them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proposal forms elicit information. They provide underwriters with the information they need to decide whether or not to accept the proposal and, if so, at what price and on what terms. Standardized forms are easier for the applicant and make underwriting more efficient and consistent.</li>
              <li>A proposal form often constitutes a legal offer by the proposer, although offers can also be made orally.</li>
              <li>Sometimes a proposal form is filled in as a request to the insurers for a quotation on price and terms. The insurer’s quotation is then the legal offer.</li>
              <li>Many proposal forms or prospectuses summarize the cover obtainable under the insurance contract.</li>
              <li>Proposal forms may also advertise other products available from the insurer.</li>
              <li>In some cases, the wording and declaration in a proposal form often warrants the truth of the answers thereon. It is to be noted, however, that this practice has now been ameliorated in view of consumer protection.</li>
              <p>On the structure of a proposal form, a typical one has four main sections. The first asks the proposer general questions relating to his/her personal details, insurance history, and details of the subject matter.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three8">Sales Literature </h3>
            <h3 id="three9">Payment of Premium </h3>
            <p>Premium paying term is the total number of years for the policy holder to pay the premium.
              Policy term is normally equal to the premium paying term. However, some insurance policies give the insured the autonomy to choose a premium paying term lower than the policy term. For instance, insurers allow the insured to get the insurance benefits even if they stop the premium payments after a stipulated period of time by converting the normal insurance policy into a paid up policy. One of the important factors to consider while buying aninsurance plan is the premium paying mode. Therefore, while opting to buy an insurance plan, one should be aware that these insurance policies come with different premium payment options. The insured should make the selection as per their requirement taking the help of an adviser. The mode of payment is the frequency in which a policy owner elects to pay premiums. Frequency options are typically annual, semi-annual, quarterly and monthly on auto insurance policies. The monthly option may be slightly higher than semi-annual premiums because additional expenses are incurred.
            </p>
            <p>The premium to be paid by any person proposing to take an insurance policy or by the policyholder to an insurer may be made in any one or more of the following manner(s), namely:-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cash</li>
              <li>Any recognized banking negotiable instrument such as cheques, including demand drafts, pay orders, banker’s cheques drawn on any scheduled bank in India</li>
              <li>Postal money orders</li>
              <li>Credit or Debit Cards held in his name</li>
              <li>Bank Guarantee or Cash Deposit</li>
              <li>Internet</li>
              <li>E-transfer</li>
              <li>Direct credits via standing instructions of proposer or the policyholder or the life insured through bank transfers and </li>
              <li>Any other method of payment as may be approved by the Authority from time to time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Regular premium payment is the most recommended mode and it involves paying premium monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. The regular premium mode is advised firstly because of the affordability factor. An annual payment would require the insured to pay his/her premium once a year. This would be the most affordable option for him/her, since the insurance company would not spend as much time and money processing payments.  If the insured chose a semi-annual payment, then he/she would pay her premium every six months (twice a year). His/her premium payments would be a bit higher than if he/she chose an annual payment frequency, but it might be easier for him/her to budget for two smaller payments instead of one larger one.  A quarterly payment would require the insured to make a payment every three months (four payments a year). The insured would find it easier to budget for four smaller payments, but his/her policy premium would be higher.  A monthly payment would require the insured to pay a premium every month (twelve times a year), and it would likely have the highest policy premium, since the insurance company would need to process these twelve payments per year</p>
            <p><strong>Online Premium Payment</strong></p>
            <p>Premium can be paid by proposer or policy holder either by cash, cheque, bank draft, bank pay order, credit/debit card, Internet or e-transfer or direct credit through bank transfer or through bank guarantee or cash deposit. As an existing policyholder he/she can now make their renewal premium payment online. It is easy, convenient and takes very little time. All they have to do is click on the link given in the website, provide their policy number and date of birth for verification and pay their premium through a secure online gateway. Premium payment can be done any online payment mode such as NEFT, Net banking, mobile banking, internet banking and other modes.</p>
            <p>An insurance premium is generally expressed as premium per thousand rupees of sum assured and is illustrated in the form of tables of premium rates by insurance companies. Premium varies across insurance plans, policy terms, sum assured and the age of the proposer. Periodicity or mode of premium payment depends on the type of policy chosen and also on the payment options that the policy offers </p>
            <p><strong>In Advance</strong></p>
            <p>Premium is required to be paid in advance and can be paid via cash up to Rs 50,000, (the limit set by IRDA for cash payments) cheque or DD. Further, most insurance companies have provided for payment of premium online.</p>
            <p><strong>Discounts Offered on Insurance Premiums</strong></p>
            <p>Often companies offer a discount on the premium rate payable on the basis of sum assured and the mode of payment of premium. </p>
            <p><strong>Rebate for Sum Assured </strong></p>
            <p>Typically most companies offer rebates for higher sum assured (higher than a certain amount). This is because the cost of servicing of all policies of the same type being almost the same, a higher sum assured means lower servicing cost per unit of sum assured. Consequently, this translates to higher profits/returns per unit of sum assured or per unit of premium paid for the company.</p>
            <p><strong>Rebate for Periodicity of Premium </strong></p>
            <p>In case of periodic premium payment policies one can normally choose to pay premium annually, half yearly, quarterly or monthly depending on one’s cash flow situation. However, higher the frequency of premium payment higher the cost of servicing (collection, processing and administrative costs) for the company. Also, if the premium is paid at one go for the whole year the funds are available (for investment) to the company for longer than in monthly mode of payment. Consequently, the company can earn more returns on the premium paid. In case of single or limited premium payment policies this rebate is often already worked into the premium rate as the mode of payment is structurally built into the policy. </p>
            <p><strong>Extra Premium</strong></p>
            <p>The normal premium tables are meant for people who do not carry any additional risk or ‘standard lives’ in insurance parlance. In case of standard lives the ordinary premium rates are applied. However, in case of people who carry extra risk because they suffer from health problems such as diabetes or heart disease or work in hazardous occupation the insurer may charge extra premium over and above the normal rate. Extra premium is also charged for any additional insurance covers (called ‘Add-ons’ or ‘riders’ in insurance jargon) are bought along with the base policy. </p>
            <p><strong>Level Premium</strong></p>
            <p>When the premium charged under a policy remains the same throughout the duration of the contract, it is called level premium. In this case premium level is guaranteed and cannot be changed by the company at a later date. This is advantageous for both the assured and the insurance company and therefore most insurance plans except some insurance plans involve level premium payment.</p>
            <p><strong>Single Premium</strong></p>
            <p>Single premium policies are normally targeted at people who are in the higher income bracket or those who have idle money with them. Single-premium policy charges the policyholder a single up-front premium payment to fully fund the policy. It was once a popular tax shelter.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Payment and Late Payment of Premium</strong></p>
            <p>In case the premium is not paid on the due date, the policy is considered as lapsed and the policyholder loses its benefits. Most policy contracts, however, provide for a 'grace period', which gives the policy holder an additional period of time after the due date for the payment of the premium. During this period, he/she can pay the premium without any extra charge and the policy will still continue to be in force.  For all  insurance policies other than term insurance, for monthly mode of payment, the grace period is usually 15 days, while for other frequency of payments (quarterly, half-yearly or yearly) it is usually one month but not less than 30 days (This means that in case of February generally 30 days grace is still given). For term insurance policies, the grace period is normally 15 days. When a policy has lapsed, it can be revived and brought to its full force by payment of overdue premiums (with interest) and a declaration about state of health or fresh medical examination. However, a lapsed policy can be revived only if the insurer agrees to do so.</p>
            <p><strong>Tax Benefit Available for Premium Paid </strong></p>
            <p>Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, any amount paid by a policyholder towards insurance premium for self, spouse or his/her children can be claimed as deduction from taxable income. Premium paid for policies in the name of any other third party (other than spouse or children) such as parents (father/mother/both) or in-laws is not eligible for deduction under section 80C If a person is paying premium for more than one insurance policy, all the premiums can be included. The benefit is available for insurance policies sold by all insurance companies – both public and private sector. </p>

            <p>In all cases of risks covered by the policies issued by an insurer, the attachment of risk to an insurer will be in consonance with the terms of Section 64VB of the Act and except in the cases where the premium has been paid in cash, in all other cases the insurer shall be on risk only after the receipt of the premium by the insurer.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, No risk to be assumed unless premium is received in advance.—</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>No insurer shall assume any risk in India in respect of any insurance business on which premium is not ordinarily payable outside India unless and until the premium payable is received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such person in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as may be prescribed, is made in advance in the prescribed manner.</li>
              <li>For the purposes of this section, in the case of risks for which premium can be ascertained in advance, the risk may be assumed not earlier than the date on which the premium has been paid in cash or by cheque to the insurer. Explanation.—Where the premium is tendered by postal money order or cheque sent by post, the risk may be assumed on the date on which the money order is booked or the cheque is posted, as the case may be.</li>
              <li>Any refund of premium which may become due to an insured on account of the cancellation of a policy or alteration in its terms and conditions or otherwise shall be paid by the insurer directly to the insured by a crossed or order cheque or by postal money order and a proper receipt shall be obtained by the insurer from the insured, and such refund shall in no case be credited to the account of the agent.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3 id="three11">Premium Receipt</h3>
            <p>Premium receipt is a receipt issued to the policyholder by the insurer or the insurer's agent which proves that payment has been received. Insurance policy receipt issued upon payment of the first premium by an applicant. It makes the policy in force before the policy documents are issued, provided the applicant meets all requirements. The insurer provides the proposal form and other related documents and the underwriter examines the form and other documents and then determines the terms on which to accept the risk or reject the same. The consent of the person assured is obtained in the form of payment of premium. After receiving the payment, the insurance company issues the first premium receipt, which acknowledges the proposal of the assured. It contains all particulars of the policy. It has the details of the next premium to be paid. The first premium receipt is an important and powerful document on the basis of which the assured can ask the insurer to issue the policy bond, which is treated as evidence of the contract of insurance.</p>
            <p>First premium receipt is also called conditional binding receipt. A conditional binding receipt is involved in life, health and certain property insurance contracts; if the insured is deemed to be covered by the insurer, the coverage begins on the date the insured receives the conditional binding receipt. Typically, a premium payment must be received by the insurer along with a completed acceptable application in order for the insured to obtain the receipt. If a premium accompanies an application, a conditional binding receipt provides that coverage will be in force from the date of application or medical examination, as long the insurer would have issued the coverage on the basis of the facts revealed on the application, medical examination and other usual sources of underwriting information. A life and health insurance policy without a conditional binding receipt is not effective until itis delivered to the insured and the premium is paid. As long as the insured is going to receive the policy anyway, the insurer is obliged to cover a claim should one occur between the time the application is received and the time the policy is officially in place. If, however, the insured is denied coverage as the typical underwriting process progresses, the insurer could nullify the conditional binding receipt, even if a premium was collected. </p>
            <p>Further the function of a conditional binding receipt can actually be divided into two separate receipts, a conditional receipt and a binding receipt. The conditional receipt is most common. Under a conditional receipt, the applicant and the insurance company form a conditional contract that is contingent upon the conditions that existed when an application or medication exam is completed. It provides that the applicant is covered immediately as long as they pass the insurer's underwriting requirements. It is the insurance agent's responsibility to tell the applicant they are covered on the condition they prove to be insurable and pass a medical exam, if one is required. A conditional receipt gives an insurance company a window of time in which they can ultimately issue or refuse to approve the policy. If, during this time, the applicant for a life insurance contract dies, the company will pay a death benefit if the policy would have been issued. A binding receipt states an insurance policy is effective upon receipt of an initial premium payment. However, should the insured die before the application is processed; benefits are fully payable, subject to limitations. The binding receipt binds an insurer to the agreement unconditionally when benefits are due up to the limits of the policy.</p>
            <p>Renewal premiums are the subsequent premiums that are paid by the insured to the insurer in order to keep the policy in operation and avail the benefits of the policy accordingly. The renewal premium receipt shows the amount of premium that the insured has paid for the policy. It can be submitted as an investment proof to the taxation authority for receiving tax benefits.</p>
            <h3 id="three12">Insurance Policy</h3>
            <p>Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company.  Insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured, known as the policyholder, which determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay. In exchange for an initial payment, known as the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered under the policy. Insurance policy as a formal contract-document issued by an insurance company to an insured,</p>

              <li>Serves as a legal evidence of the insurance agreement, </li>
              <li>Sets out the exact terms on which the indemnity cover has been provided, and</li>
              <li>States associated information such as the</li>

              <li>Deductibles, if any</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The contract sets out the terms and conditions under which you agree to pay a premium to the insurance company, and the terms and conditions under which the insurance company agrees to compensate you for loss after an unforeseen event. All insurance policies include terms and conditions that describe the ways in which the policy will operate and specify what is included and what is not, what the insurance company promises to do and what the policyholder promises to do. All insurance policies have certain basic components, usually in the following order</p>
            <ul>
              <p><li>Recital Clause:</li>This is also known as the preamble. It gives a start for arriving at the operative clause (the scope of cover provided under the policy is mentioned, followed up by exceptions to indicate the precise range of cover) by saying that as the insured has made a proposal and declaration (which shall form the basis of the contract) for taking out a policy of insurance and as he has paid or agreed to pay the premium, therefore, the insurer agrees to provide him cover in respect of loss, damage or destruction etc. as per the Operative Clause</p>
              <p><li>Declarations:</li>Identifies who is an insured, the insured's address, the insuring company, what risks or property are covered, the policy limits (amount of insurance), any applicable deductibles, the policy period and premium amount. These are usually provided on a form that is filled out by the insurer based on the insured's application and attached on top of or inserted within the first few pages of the policy.</p>
              <P><li>Definitions:</li>Defines important terms used in the rest of the policy.</P>
              <P><li>Insuring Agreement:</li>Describes the covered perils, or risks assumed, or nature of coverage. This is where the insurance company makes one or more express promises to indemnify the insured.</P>
              <p><li>Exclusions:</li>The exclusions section tells what is not covered under the policy. Exclusions takes coverage away from the insuring agreement by describing property, perils, hazards or losses arising from specific causes which are not covered by the policy.</p>
              <p><li>Terms and Conditions:</li>These are fundamental components of the insurance contract. If you do not comply with the terms and conditions of the policy, you may be in breach of the contract with the insurer. This may mean that the insurer is not obliged to fulfill its promise and pay out some or all of your claim. These are specific provisions, rules of conduct, duties, and obligations which the insured must comply with in order for coverage to incept, or must remain in compliance with in order to keep coverage in effect. Terms and conditions may be found throughout the policy and are important areas to highlight for reference in the case of a loss, because they often outline exactly what requirements must be met in order to ensure coverage.</p>
              <p><li>Endorsements:</li>Additional forms attached to the policy that modify it in some way, either unconditionally or upon the existence of some condition.</p>
              <p><li>Riders:</li>A rider is used to convey the terms of a policy amendment and the amendment thereby becomes part of the policy.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three13">Endorsements</h3>
            <p>An insurance endorsement is an amendment or addition to an existing insurance contract which changes the terms or scope of the original policy. Endorsements may also be referred to as riders. The purpose of an endorsement is a policy change. An insurance endorsement may be used to add, delete, exclude or otherwise alter coverage. An insurance endorsement may be issued mid-term, at the time of purchase, or at renewal. The insurance endorsement is a legally binding amendment to the insurance contract.  Insurance companies create endorsements to offer options to the insured to add coverage or increase coverage limits, but insurers may also issue special endorsements to limit or restrict coverage. Insurance policy endorsements may serve any number of functions, including broadening the scope of coverage, limiting or restricting the scope of coverage, clarifying the application of coverage to some unique loss exposure, adding other parties as insured, or adding locations to the policy. An endorsement alters the policy and becomes part of your legal insurance contract. It remains in force until the expiry of the policy and may renew under the same terms and conditions as the rest of your policy. The exception to this is if the endorsement specifies a specific term which the endorsement is valid. Endorsements can be divided into categories based on their purpose. Most fall into one of the following groups,</p>
            <ul>
              <p><li>Exclusions:</li>Many endorsements are intended to exclude coverage for certain types of claims.</p>
              <p><li>Added Coverage:</li>Endorsements are used to add a type of coverage that is not provided by the basic policy.</p>
              <p><li>Modification of Coverage:</li>Some endorsements expand the existing coverage.. Other endorsements reduce the scope of coverage. For instance, an insurer attaches an endorsement to a general liability policy that replaces the standard contractual liability exclusion with one that is more restrictive.</p>
              <p><li>Editorial Changes:</li>Some endorsements are added to clarify the intent of the policy without altering the coverage. The insurer uses an endorsement to replace one word or phrase with another.</p>
              <p><li>Administrative Changes:</li>Endorsements may be added for administrative purposes, such as changing the insurer's mailing address or correcting the name of the policyholder.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three14">Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938 (Rebating)</h3>
            <p>Rebating is returning a portion of the premium or the agent's/broker's commission on the premium to the insured or other inducements to place business with a specific insurer.  In the insurance business, rebating is a practice whereby something of value is given to sell the policy that is not provided for in the policy itself. An example of rebating is when the prospective insurance buyer receives a refund of all or part of the commission for the insurance sale. Rebates can be made in the form of cash, gifts, services, payment of premiums, employment, or almost any other thing of value.  Rebating is illegal and no intermediary is allowed to induce anyone to take a policy. Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938 is hence an important section for an insurance agent. As per Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938, Prohibition of rebates means</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>No person shall allow or offer to allow, either directly or indirectly, as an inducement to any person to take out or renew or continue an insurance in respect of any kind of risk relating to lives or property in India, any rebate of the whole or part of the commission payable or any rebate of the premium shown on the policy, nor shall any person taking out or renewing or continuing a policy accept any rebate, except such rebate as may be allowed in accordance with the published prospectuses or tables of the insurer: Provided that acceptance by an insurance agent of commission in connection with a policy of life insurance taken out by himself on his own life shall not be deemed to be acceptance of a rebate of premium within the meaning of this sub section if at the time of such acceptance the insurance agent satisfies the prescribed conditions establishing that he is a bona fide insurance agent employed by the insurer.</li>
              <li>Any person making default in complying with the provisions of this section shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="three15">Insurance Claim</h3>
            <p>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. An insurance claim is when you have a loss or sustain damage that is caused by a peril insured by your insurance policy. The insurance policy provides coverage and compensation to the insured for covered losses or the damages that he/she sustains by way of he/she making a claim. The insurance company validates the claim and, once approved, issues payment to the insured or an approved interested party on behalf of the insured. Insurance claims cover everything from death benefits on life insurance policies to routine and comprehensive medical exams. In many cases, third-parties file claims on behalf of the insured person, but usually only the person(s) listed on the policy is entitled to claim payments.</p>
            <h3 id="three16">Intimation of Claim</h3>
            <p>Claim intimation is the first step of any notification of the claim to the insurer. This is often called as First Notification of Loss (FNOL). Notification of the claim does not necessarily mean the insurance company is paying for the loss. Claim accepted means the insurer has agreed to consider the claim for payout. The insurance company has to go through the formalities of investigating into the validity of the claim made, before accepting the responsibility of paying the amount. This is when we term it as claims intimated but not accepted. In due course, claims intimated may be accepted by the company. However, the amount is not yet paid and is still due to the insured. This is termed as claims intimated, accepted but not paid.</p>
            <p>A policyholder is supposed to inform an insurance company as soon as a claim occurs. So, if you, for instance, damage your car in an accident, you need to inform the insurer quickly. Or, if you are hospitalized and pay for the bills, you need to inform the insurer quickly to process the reimbursement if you have a health insurance policy. Insurers like to know as soon as the claim is made so that they can get into the thick of things and investigate all documents and assess the losses. Also, if there is no deadline, then the insurers would not know their liabilities and won’t be able to provision for it. So while some insurers may not specify the time within which you are supposed to intimate a claim, some insurers may put it down clearly. When you sign up for the policy, this is a question you need to ask and get an answer to. For instance, in the case of reimbursement, a health insurance policy document states that notice of claim should be made within 72 hours before admission in case of planned hospitalisation and not later than 48 hours or before discharge in case of emergency hospitalisation. Subsequently the claim documents need to be submitted within 30 days from the date of discharge. If an insurer spells out a timeline and the insured does not inform the insurer about the claim within that, the claim is considered delayed.</p>
            <p>If you delay, then on technical grounds the insurer can reject a claim. However, IRDAI, while recognizing the importance of having a deadline to intimate a claim with all the relevant documents, held the view that this should not prevent insurers from settling genuine claims where there was a delay in intimating a claim due to unavoidable circumstances. Accordingly, the regulator directed the insurer to not reject paying out delayed claims until the reasons for delay are ascertained and the insurer is sure that the delayed claim would have been rejected even if it was reported on time. Accordingly, insurers were instructed to incorporate additional wordings in the policy document, stating that a delayed claim will be paid where the delay is proven to be for reasons beyond the control of the policyholder. Irdai recently reiterated its stance regarding handling of delayed claims. While regulations protect the insured against a delay due to unavoidable circumstances, it is always advisable to intimate a claim as soon as possible. </p>
            <h3 id="three17">Appointment of a Surveyor</h3>
            <p>Surveyors are professionals who assess the loss or damage and serve as a link between the insurer and the insured. They usually function only in non-life business. Their job is to assess the actual loss and avoid false claims. Surveyors like agents, are not employees but are independent professionals hired by the insurance company. A person intending to act as a surveyor and loss assessor (S& LA) in respect of general insurance has to apply to the IRDAI for the grant of license to act as such. IRDAI shall satisfy itself that the applicant, in addition to submitting the application complete in all respects:- satisfies all the applicable requirements of section 64UM read with section 42D of the Act and rule 56A of the Insurance Rules, 1939;possesses such additional technical qualifications as may be specified by IRDAI from time to time; has furnished evidence of payment of fees for grant of license, depending upon the categorization; has undergone a period of practical training, not exceeding 12 months, as contained in Chapter VII of these regulations; and furnishes such additional information as may be required by IRDAI from time to time.</p>
            <p>The insurance regulator has rolled out new guidelines on appointment of surveyors and assessors for assessing a loss in a general insurance policy. Recently a rule was passed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) vide circular dated July 14th, 2015, stating that claim amount should not exceed an amount specified by the regulator, unless the claim settlement report is obtained from a person who holds license to act as surveyor and loss assessor. The guidelines of appointment of surveyor’s state</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Surveyors and Loss Assessors shall be appointed either by insurers or insured to assess loss for policies having premium above Rs. 20,000 </li>
              <li>Insured or claimant needs to notify claim to the insurer in the stipulated time allowed by insurer. Upon claim notification, the insurer should immediately respond to the insured or claimant, about any further requirements. In case, if surveyor is required to be appointed to assess the claim, the insurers needs to appoint the person within 72 hours of the receipt of intimation from the insured or claimant. </li>
              <li>Appointment of Surveyors and Loss Assessors should not be outsourced by the insurers.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities of a Surveyor</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>He should investigate, quantify, validate and deal with losses and report thereon; carry out the work with competence, objectivity and professional integrity by strictly adhering to the Code of Conduct.</li>
              <li>He should maintain confidentiality and neutrality without jeopardizing the liability of the Insurer and the claim of the Insured.</li>
              <li>He should examine, inquire, investigate, and verify the cause and circumstances of the loss including extent of loss, nature of ownership and insurable interest.</li>
              <li>He should estimate, measure and determine the quantum and description of the loss.</li>
              <li>He should comment on the admissibility of the loss and also whether conditions and warranties have been observed under the policy.</li>
              <li>He should assess the liability under the contract of insurance and also point out discrepancies, if any, in the policy wordings.</li>
              <li>He should give reasons for repudiation of a claim in case the claim is not covered under the policy terms and conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three18">Survey Report</h3>
            <p>A surveyor and loss assessor, whether appointed by insurer or insured, is expected to submit the report to the insurer within 30 days of being appointed—and a copy of the report to the insured as well, with comments on the assessment of loss. If required, the surveyor can seek an extension while keeping the insured informed about the same. However, regardless of any extensions, a surveyor has to submit the report within 6 months from the date of appointment.  If the insurance company finds a survey report to be incomplete, it can ask the surveyor for an additional report, which needs to be submitted within 3 weeks. Such an additional report can be sought only one time during a single claim cycle. </p>
            <p>A surveyor’s job is first to assess the quantum of loss and then comment on the admissibility of the claim i.e. Whether, in his opinion, the losses are due to the peril covered by the policy and are payable under the terms of the policy. His report is recommendatory. He assesses the liability on the basis of physical inspection and going through the books of account and other relevant documents and explanations given by the client to substantiate the loss. His job is to strictly go by the wordings of the policy, though he may make additional comments and observations relevant to the loss. Any genuine losses the client may have suffered, which could not be substantiated at the time of the survey, can still be taken up with the insurance company. If the quantum of loss is in dispute and/or the insurer is not convinced by the client or vice versa, legal recourse is available under the arbitration clause. The surveyor only assesses the loss and recommends an amount. It is for the insurer to accept it or otherwise. After all, it is the insurance company which ultimately picks up the tab and not the surveyor.</p>
            <p>The insurance company cannot ignore the report in toto if it is based on facts and figures. However, it can always call for additional information from the surveyor or the insured if it is not satisfied with the loss assessment or even go for second opinion or assessment. It can also obtain a specialist’s opinion. In an extreme situation, where it has strong reasons to do so (eg; mala fide on the part of the surveyor), it can ignore the report and order a fresh survey to be conducted.</p>
            <p>While the surveyor’s report definitely is privileged and confidential (except in case of marine losses) and the insurance company may not divulge all the details of the report; it is definitely bound to furnish to the insured the working of the claim amount i.e. How the surveyor has arrived at a particular figure of the final claim amount. Contrary to popular belief, the insured can demand a resurvey if they feel that the surveyor has grossly erred in assessing the loss. The insured will have to convince the insurer that there was a gross mistake in assessing the loss. Some of the large broking houses have a panel of surveyors whose help can be taken by the corporate in event of a claim. In the event of a loss, the surveyors can work with the corporate in properly presenting the claim to the surveyor deployed by the insurance company. If the papers are presented in sync with the requirements of the surveyor, it helps him in getting more focused and the turnaround time for submission of the report and the settlement of the claim is drastically reduced.</p>
            <h3 id="three19">Claim Forms</h3>
            <p>A claim form which has to be filled in when making an insurance claim. The content of the claim form vary with each class of insurance. In general the claim form is designed to get full information regarding the circumstances of the loss, such as date of loss, time, cause of loss, extent of loss and so on. The other questions vary from one class of insurance to another. In addition to claim forms certain documents are required to be submitted or secured by the insurer to substantiate the claim. For example, for fire claims, a report	from the fire brigade would be necessary; for cyclone damage, a report from the meteorological office may be called for; in burglary claims, a report from the police may be necessary; for motor claims the insurer may like to examine driving licence, police report, RC, and son on; in marine cargo claims the number of documents varies according to the type of loss i.e. total loss, particular average, inland or overseas transit claims and so on.</p>

            <p>Important aspects in an insurance claim</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first aspect to be decided is whether loss is within the scope of the policy. The legal doctrine of proximate cause provides guidelines to decide whether the loss is caused by an insured peril or an excluded peril. The burden of proof that the loss is within the scope of the policy is upon the insured. However, if the loss is caused by an excluded peril the onus of proof is on the insurer.</li>
              <li>The second aspect to be decided is whether the insured has complied with policy conditions especially conditions which are precedent to liability.</li>
              <li>The third aspect is in respect is in respect of compliance with warranties. The survey report would indicate whether or not warranties have been complied with.</li>
              <li>The fourth aspect relates to the observance of utmost good faith by the proposer, during the currency of the policy. </li>
              <li>On the occurrence of a loss, the insured is expected to act as if is uninsured. In other words, he has a duty to take measure 	to minimise the loss.</li>
              <li>The last aspect concerns the determination of the amount payable. The amount of loss payable is subject to the sum insured. However the amount payable will also depend upon the following. The extent of the insured’s insurable interest in the property affected; the value of salvage; application of underinsurance and application of contribution and subrogation conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>Investigation is different from the assessment of loss. Investigation is done to ensure that a valid claim has been made verify the important details and doubts such as absence of insurable interest, suppression or misrepresentation of material facts, deliberately creating the loss and so on are ruled out. </P>
            <P>Motor third party claims involving death and personal injuries are assessed on the basis of doctor’s report. These claims are dealt by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and the amount to be paid is decided by factors like the age and income of the claimant. Claims involving third party property damage are assessed on the basis of a survey report. Motor own damage claim is assessed on the basis of surveyors report. It may require police report if third party damage is involved. Health insurance claims are assessed either in house or by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) on behalf of the non-life insurance companies. The assessment is based on the medical reports and expert opinion.</P>
            <h3 id="three20">Section 64 UM of the Insurance Act, 1938</h3>
            <p>Where, incase of a claim of less than INR 20,000/- in value on any policy of insurance it is not practicable for an insurer to employ an approved surveyor or loss assessor without incurring expenses disproportionate to the amount of claim, the insurer may employ any other person (not being a person disqualified for the time being for being employed as surveyor or loss assessor) for surveying such loss and may pay such reasonable fee or remuneration to the person so  employed as he may think fit.</p>
            <p><strong>Categories of Claims</strong></p>
            <p>The claims which are dealt with in insurance policies fall into the following categories.</p>
            <p><strong>Standard Clams: </strong> These are claims which are clearly within the terms and conditions of the policy. The assessment of claim is done keeping in view the scope and the sum insured opted for and other methods indemnity laid down for various classes of insurance. The claim payable by the insurer takes in	to account various factors like valuation at time of the loss, insurable interest, salvage prospects, loss of earnings, loss of use, depreciation, replacement value 	depending on the policy taken</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Standard Claims:</strong> These are claims where the insured must have committed breach of condition or warranty. The settlement of these claims is considered subject to rules and regulations framed by non-life insurance companies</p>
            <p><strong>Condition of Average or Average Clause:</strong> This is a condition in some policies which penalises the insured for insuring property at sum insured less than its actual value known as underinsurance. In the event of a claim the insured gets an amount that is proportionately reduced from his actual loss in accordance to the amount underinsured.</p>
            <p><strong>Acts of God Perils – Catastrophic Losses:</strong> Natural perils such as storm, cyclone, flood inundation and earthquake are termed as ‘acts of God’ perils. These perils may result in losses to many policies of insurer in the affected region. In such major catastrophic losses, the surveyor is asked to proceed to the loss site immediately for an early assessment and loss minimisation efforts. Simultaneously, insurers’ officials also visit the scene of loss particularly when the amount involved is large. The purpose of the visit is to obtain an immediate, on the spot idea of the nature and extent of loss.</p>
            <h3 id="three21">Discharge Vouchers</h3>
            <p>Settlement of claim is made only after obtaining a discharge under the policy. A discharge voucher represents culmination of insurance claim, which is evidence of payment. Wherever there are no disputes by the insured/s or claimant/s to the amount offered by the insurer towards settlement of a claim, the present system of obtaining the discharge voucher may be continued, IRDAI said. The insurers must ensure that the vouchers collected are dated and complete in all respects while obtaining the signature/s of the insured persons or claimant(s). In case the amount offered is disputed by the insured or claimant, insurers should take steps to pay the amount assessed without waiting for the voucher discharged. However, under no circumstances the discharge vouchers shall be collected under duress, by coercion, by force or compulsion, from the insured.</p>
            <h3 id="three22">Payment of Claim</h3>
            <p>A claim and its payment are the end result of the insurance process. With respect to life insurance, this means that the insured has died and the beneficiary is in line to collect from the insurer what is due. Unlike property or casualty insurance, claims made on a life insurance policy are rarely negotiated. They are either paid or denied. When proof of the death of the insured arrives at the insurer's claims department, the records are checked to validate that the policy was in force at the time of death and ensure that the person to whom the policy proceeds are to be paid is the rightful beneficiary.</p>
            <p>When an insured dies, the life insurance company should be notified as soon as is possible and practical. Once the company has received the proper forms, there's usually little or no delay in payment of the claim, especially when it's obvious that the claim is valid – the policy is in force, the beneficiary is available, there's no evidence of suicide within the limitations of the contract's suicide clause, and so on. Valid life insurance claims are generally paid in relatively short order, usually within a few days. This policy also helps to foster goodwill with the public, which is one of the life insurance industry's most valuable selling tools.</p>
            <p>In the fields of property or casualty insurance, the amount of individual claims paid is often less than the face amount of the policy. In contrast, life insurance is generally paid at the full face value of the policy. There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule: the first is when there's an outstanding loan against the cash value of the policy. The amount of the loan, along with any unpaid interest, is deducted from the policy's face amount before payment is made to the beneficiary. The second exception is if there's a premium payment due. Insurance contracts often extend a grace period of up to a month after passing of the premium due date before the policy lapses. If the insured dies within this grace period, the amount of the premium due would be deducted from the policy's face amount before payment is made to the beneficiary.</p>
            <p>The third exception that would prevent a life insurance policy's full-face value from being paid is when an error was made in determining the age or gender of the insured at the time the policy was issued. If such an error is discovered upon the insured's death, the insurance company will compute the face amount that the premium would have purchased if the accurate information was originally used and pay that amount to the beneficiary. Such occurrences are actually not that unusual. Some may be intentional, but most are simply mistakes. In either case, the discrepancy is not deemed material enough to completely void the policy.</p>
            <p>In indemnity policies, the upper limit of a claim is the sum assured and this usually applies for the period of the policy. Certain policies, however, allow for reinstatement of the Sum Insured by payment of proportionate premium for the remaining period of the policy. The actual claim will be the actual extent of financial loss as validated by documents like bills. If the property is underinsured, the insured shall bear a rate able proportion of the loss. There can be more than one claim in the policy period but the sum assured is usually the limit for the policy period unless reinstated. Nowadays health insurance policies - which cover hospitalisation costs - have also a cashless settlement of claims. That is, you don't have to pay for the treatment at the hospital and then make a claim for reimbursement of the expenses. The insurance company has a service provider called the third party administrator (TPA) health services, who liaises with the hospitals and directly makes the payment for your treatment as per the terms of your policy and coverage.</p>
            <p><strong>Life Insurance Claim Process</strong></p>
            <p>A Life Insurance Policy can be claimed if your claim falls in one of the below categories</p>
            <ol>
              <li>On maturity of the policy you bought. On completion of term you can renew or withdraw your invested amount.</li>
              <li>On death of the person on whom policy was issued, if it occurred before maturity of the policy, then his nominees can avail the policy amount on the basis of terms & condition mentioned.</li>

                <li>But in case the policyholder dies then his nominees gets the amount so they can stabilize their life and don’t fall into any financial in securities.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>After completion of policy period. The insurance company sends out a letter informing that on which date the policy money will be paid to the policyholder. </li>
                <li>However in case you do not receive any letter from your company, then follow up with your insurance company or agent through whom you bought the policy.</li>
                <li>The policyholder must submit discharge form duly filled with policy document. </li>
                <li>After receiving these two documents post-dated cheque is sent by post to policyholder before due date.</li>
                <li>Few policies like money back policy is paid in intervals to the policyholders. But provided that he/she should do the remaining payment for the premium.</li>
                <li>In cases where amount payable is less than a fixed amount (in LIC the limit is up to rs.60,000), cheques are released without receiving discharge receipt or policy document. However, in case of higher amounts these two requirements are insisted upon. </li>

            <p>Insurance can be widely segregated in three categories–life, health and general. General insurance is insurance for valuables other than our life and health. General insurance covers the insurer against damage, loss and theft of your valuables. The premium and cover of general insurance depends upon the type and extent of insurance. A general insurance policy typically has a period of a few years. General insurance or non-life insurance helps you to safeguard yourself and the things around, which you value a lot. General insurance covers insurance of property against fire, burglary, theft; personal insurance covering health, travel and accidents; and liability insurance covering legal liabilities.

            <p><strong>Key Features of Motor Insurance Policy</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Third Party Insurance:</strong>This insurance is mandatory by law. It protects a policy holder against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death to a third party or any damage to property. Here third party includes people travelling with you or whom the insured person injures and claims damages at the time of accident. But this insurance does not protect you, your vehicle and co-passengers against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death.</p>
            <p><strong>Comprehensive Insurance:</strong>This type of insurance will cover third party liabilities as well as damages caused to you and your car. You will receive financial protection against liabilities arising from natural disasters, theft, and accidents. Comprehensive insurance plans include third-party premium and own-damage premium. Own-damage premium is determined based on the age of the car, make and model of the car, geographical location, and engine capacity.

This includes accidents, natural disasters, theft, man-made calamities, in-transit damages, and third-party liability claims for loss of life, injuries, and property damage. In return, the policyholder pays a premium to the insurance company. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, all vehicles in India are mandated to have at least third-party liability insurance cover. Riding a bike without insurance can attract heavy penalties. Apart from being the law, two wheeler insurance is an essential investment as it provides the rider complete peace of mind when he/she is on the road. The protection that the insurance offers against third-party liability claims is noteworthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Feature of Two-Wheeler Insurance</strong></p>

Third party insurance is compulsory under Indian law and all two wheelers are required to have this form of insurance. Liability only insurance covers the legal cost arising out of damage resulting in personal injury, property damage or death to a third party due to the insured vehicle.

This is an additional benefit that is offered to two-wheeler owners. This serves as an additional cover in the event the owner is injured, with the insurance company covering the cost up to a certain limit.</p>
            <p><strong>Comprehensive Insurance:</strong>This insurance plan includes two types of coverage. The protection offered by one part of this insurance is similar to that offered by the standalone liability-only plan explained above. It protects the bike owner from liabilities to a third party due to accidental injuries, death, or property damage. The other part of the insurance plan protects the insured vehicle from a host of events, including accidents, theft, in-transit damages, natural disasters, man-made calamities, etc. The vehicle owner is also offered Personal Accident cover under this scheme. Comprehensive two-wheeler insurance covers damage to the vehicle arising out of natural and man-made calamities as well as coverage for the owner and rider. Comprehensive bike insurance provides complete protection in the event of an accident resulting in partial or total damage to the insured vehicle. It also covers the owner and the co-rider (included as an add-on) through personal accident cover. With a two-wheeler comprehensive insurance policy, you can enjoy good protection for your vehicle when it is stolen, damaged, or lost. It also provides personal accident cover to the owner or rider of the vehicle. Apart from this, it will also cover third-party liability.</p>

In the event of death of term insurance policyholder during policy term, the beneficiary can claim death benefits from the insurance company. Term insurance is a pure life insurance product, which provides financial protection in case of death of the life insured during the term of the policy. A term insurance plan is the most affordable form of life insurance cover. It is designed to financially protect ones family in case of death of the bread-earner</p>
            <p><strong>Features of Term Insurance Plan</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Flexible Payment Options:</strong>Term insurance policies offer flexible premium payment options, allowing policyholders to choose a payment plan based on their convenience. Premiums can be either limited pay, single pay or regular pay plans. Policyholders who choose limited or regular pay plans can pay their premiums either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.</p>
            <p><strong>High Sum Assured for Low Premiums:</strong>Term insurance premiums are some of the lowest in the insurance sector, allowing for a prudent and relatively inexpensive way to safeguard the policyholder’s dependents in case of untimely demise. The Sum Assured associated with term insurance plans are also relatively high when compared to the premium amounts. Regular plans as well as TROP plans offer as much as 105% return on premiums paid as a benefit upon maturity.</p>
            <p><strong>Choice of Plan:</strong>A number of insurers offer policyholders a choice when it comes to the type of plan they wish to opt for. Policyholders can choose between single or joint life plans, depending on their need. They can thus choose to extend coverage for dependent spouses or choose a plan exclusively for the breadwinner of the family.</p>
            <p><strong>Death Benefit:</strong>On the death of the policyholder during the policy term, his/her dependents stand to receive the amount chosen at the time of choosing the policy. The amount would depend on the term plan, with the amount increasing, decreasing or remaining the same irrespective of at what juncture of the policy tenure the policyholder’s death occurs.</p>
            <p><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong>Policyholders can claim tax exemptions under various sections by virtue of opting for a term insurance policy. Tax exemptions can be got under section 80C of the Income Tax Act on premium amounts. Policyholders can also claim exemptions under Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act for benefits received through insurance policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Survival Benefits:</strong>While a regular term insurance plan does not have any survival benefits, a number of insurers have designed plans that also offer survival benefits in the form of premium refunds on maturity. On maturity of the policy, surviving policyholders stand to receive benefits under a TROP policy only. In the case of a TROP policy, the policyholder will receive the premium amount paid over the policy tenure as one lump sum.</p>
            <p><strong>Add-on Benefits: A number of individuals have begun to opt for add-on features to their regular term insurance policies. These add-on plans will push up the price of the premium being paid but provide additional benefits in case of accidental death, critical illness, total and permanent disability benefit etc.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Types of Term Insurance Plans</strong>Insurance companies offer a wide range of term insurance plans with exciting features and benefits to stand out amongst competitors in the insurance space. Term insurance can be classified into the following types:</p>
            <p><strong>Regular Term Insurance Plans:</strong>A regular term insurance plan is a no-frills insurance plan that provides coverage against a specific set of risks on payment of a pre-decided premium amount. These plans offer no benefits upon maturity. Premium payments can be made periodically or they can be paid at once (single pay). The options for insurance cover can go as high as the insurer is willing to underwrite and the policy tenures can be as high as 20 years. When the policy matures, the insurance cover ceases, as does the need to pay premiums for such a cover. This is the most basic form of life insurance protection. Regular term insurance also comes with low premiums and high sum assured. This ensures that the policyholder can receive maximum benefits from the plan in a cost-effective manner.</p>
            <p><strong>Group Term Insurance Plans:</strong>Group Term Insurance policies are offered to a group of individuals by an employing organisation, association, or trusts and societies. It provides coverage to each and every member insured under the plan. It is also less expensive compared to an individual term insurance plan. Group term plans offer more or less the same benefits as individual plans, however, the only disadvantage is that the coverage expires once the employment or membership ends. As is made obvious by the name, a group term insurance plan is meant to be an insurance instrument that can be used by a group to secure its members against untoward occurrences. These plans can be taken by any group of people or companies for their employees but can come with one essential clause or mandate set by the insurer where the policy will require a minimum number of people participating in it. For example, if a policy says that it will cover groups of at least 20 people then a small company that has less than 20 employees won’t be able to purchase the policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Convertible Term Insurance Plans:</strong>A convertible term plan allows the policyholder to convert his/her policy into a permanent one during the policy tenure. Some insurers provide this as an additional benefit rider while others offer the same as a standalone plan. As far as the terms and conditions have been met, converting a term life policy into a permanent policy should not be a difficult process.</p>
            <p><strong>Term Return of Premium (TROP):</strong>TROP plans are standard term life insurance plans with a slight variation in the method of providing survival benefits. On survival, policyholders are returned the total amount of premiums paid by them during the policy tenure, excluding tax. Such a method ensures that the money spent on the policy is returned to you after a specific interval.</p>
            <p><strong>Decreasing and Increasing Term Plans:</strong>The insurance market is flooded with various types of policies that it often becomes difficult for the buyer to choose the best suited plan. Decreasing and increasing insurance policies are two of the commonly used terms in the insurance realm. Let’s take a look at the features and benefits of the aforementioned policies:</p>

            <p><strong>Decreasing Term Insurance:</strong>In this type of policy, the sum assured on death as well as the premium decreases at a certain rate throughout the policy term. Such plans are generally offered by financial institutions to insure the property held as collateral against the loan offered. It is an additional safety component which ensures that the bank will get back the amount released as loan, in case of the worst scenario. The duration of the policy term can vary between 1 and 30 years. The essence of decreasing term insurance is that a person’s requirement for high insurance coverage decreases with age, as certain liabilities do not exist beyond a point. Decreasing term insurance plans are not suitable for individuals who have no other form of life coverage. If you buy only one life insurance package, it should be a pure term insurance policy, as it would offer you a level death benefit throughout the tenure. While the main advantage of choosing decreasing term insurance is that it can be used for personal asset protection, small businesses also use these plans to insure indebtedness for startup expenses or operational costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Increasing Term Insurance:</strong>Under increasing term insurance plans, the insurance coverage increases at specified durations when the policy is in full force. It evaluates risks on par with the rising costs at any given time in the future and compensates accordingly. The cover usually keeps increasing till the time it attains a value which is 1.5 times higher than the original cover. Increasing term life insurance policies are configured to offer respite from inflation. It also ensures that the death benefit is substantial when it is finally paid out to the nominee. One of the main disadvantages of the increasing term insurance plan is that the premium increases according to the benefit. Hence, these policies get more expensive over time. Increasing term insurance is less common than other forms of term insurance. These plans are particularly suitable for couples who plan to have a child in the near future, and would like to save up for the same.</p>
            <p><strong>Joint Term Insurance Plans:</strong>As the name suggests, joint term insurance plans are those schemes which allow the person insured to cover his/her spouse under the same policy. It is a comprehensive financial protection solution with multiple benefits for couples. It basically ensures that the family equilibrium remains intact during hardships, or in the worst case, during the absence of one of the two or both. These policies are well suited for married couples with dependent children.</p>

            <h3 id="five1">Grievances Redressal Mechanism</h3>
            <p>Grievance Redress Mechanism is part and parcel of the administrative machinery of every business entity. No such entity can claim to be accountable, responsive and user friendly unless it has established an efficient and effective grievance redress mechanism. The insurance industry essentially being a service industry can exist and survive only if there is a customer. In this people-centric business where the customer expectations are ever rising grievances are bound to arise. And if customer has a grievance and that grievance is not satisfied it may lead to fall in the reputation of the insurance company and resultant loss of customer. Therefore, handling customer grievance is very important in insurance. To redress these grievances and to lubricate the insurance machinery grievance redressal mechanism has been provided for insurance disputes. The grievance redressal mechanism for insurance related dispute has been gathered hereafter.</p>
            <p><strong>(a) Grievance Redressal Cell of Insurers</strong></p>
            <p>It is incumbent upon the insurers on continuous basis to have in place an independent and transparent grievance redress machinery to resolve grievances in conformity with Redress of Public Grievances Rules, 1998. Apart from this, Regulation 5 of the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders Interests) Regulations, 2006, stipulate that every insurer shall have in place, proper procedures and effective mechanism to address complaints and grievances of policyholders efficiently and with speed. So, every insurer must establish a ‘grievance cell’ at their office in order to address the grievances and problems of their policyholders. These in house grievance redress units are fully aligned with the IRDAI guidelines on grievance redressal and have excellent setup to handle customer grievances. The annual reports of the IRDAI contain information about the number of grievances received by the public and private insurers, grievances settled and disposed and those pending with them. In order to improve grievance settlement mechanism in the industry, the IRDAI appointed a Committee to Look into Grievance Redressal System of insurers and suggest modifications of the regulations for the protection of policyholders.</p>
            <p>Insurance Companies are committed to resolve grievance in a cost effective and impartial manner. As a matter of fact, even before any difference of opinion between the insurer and insured graduates to a grievance to be resolved by ‘In-house Grievance Redressal Machinery’ the organization is required to provide credible arrangement for expeditious hearing of such difference of opinion and address the issues through negotiations, promptly and impartially.  Insurance companies look into and resolve the grievances of their prospective and existing customers who have any issue regarding their products and services before, during and afterwards. They track and monitor the complaints and coordinate to resolve the complaints within the time frame mentioned in the policy. An in-depth analysis of the complaint is done to identify the root cause of complaint and identify issues pertaining to products, process and system. They also conduct a trend analysis of the complaints received and give suitable directions to the various departments to heal the trouble.  However, if the in-house grievance redressal mechanism fails to resolve the grievance amicably or fails to respond to the insured within 30 days, the aggrieved insured has a right to make complaint for amicable resolution at industry level through ‘insurance ombudsman’ so as to get rid of the conflict of interest between insured and insurer. Apart from this, the IRDAI has also established its own grievance cell at its headquarters for discontented insurance customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
            <p>Every company has instituted an in-house grievance settlement procedure. And the policyholders who have a complaint against the insurer are required to first approach the Grievance/Customer Complaint Cell of the concerned insurer.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Every insurer shall have a board approved grievance redressal policy which shall be filed with IRDAI. The system and procedure for receiving, registering and disposing of grievances and other relevant details along with details of turnaround times shall be clearly mentioned in the policy.</li>
              <li>Every insurer shall have a designated Grievance Officer of a senior management level to hear the grievances of policyholders. Senior Management would mean either the CEO or the compliance Officer. </li>
              <li>An insurer shall send a written acknowledgement to a complainant within 3 working days of receipt of the grievance. The acknowledgement shall contain the name and designation of the officers who will deal with the grievance. It shall also contain details of the insurer’s grievance redressal procedure and the time taken for resolution of disputes. </li>
              <li>Where the insurer resolves the dispute within 3 working days, it may communicate the resolution along with acknowledgement. Where the grievance is not resolved within 3 working days, an insurer shall resolve the grievance within 2 weeks of its receipt or reject the complaint and gives reasons for doing so.</li>
              <li> The insurer shall inform the complainant about how he/she may pursue the complainant, if dissatisfied. The insurer shall inform that it will regard the complaint as closed if it does not receive a reply within 8 weeks from date of receipt of response by the insured/policyholder.</li>
              <li>Any failure on the part of insurers to follow the above-mentioned procedures and time frames would attract penalties by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.</li>
              <li>All insurers should publicize its grievance redressal procedure and ensure that it is specifically made available on website. It is also necessary for the insurers to have in place the automated system that will enable online registration, tracking of status of grievances by complainants and periodical reports prescribed by IRDAI.</li>
              <li>Insurers shall also have in place a system to receive and deal with all kinds of calls including voicemail, e-mail, relating to grievances from prospects and policyholders. The system should enable and facilitate the required interfacing with IRDAI’s system of handling calls and e-mails.</li>
              <li>However, if the policyholder do not receive a response from insurer within a reasonable time or are dissatisfied with the response of the company they may approach the grievance cell of IRDAI.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>(b) Grievance Redressal Cell of IRDAI</strong></p>
            <p>The interest of policyholder is on top of the agenda of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. IRDAI has established its own grievance cell at its headquarter for discontented insurance customers. A recent introduction by IRDAI for the facilitation of policyholder is IRDAI Grievance Call Centre (IGCC). IGCC acts as an additional and easily accessible channel for policy holders to lodge their grievances and also seek their status over phone/email. If need arises then investigations and inquiries are carried out by IRDAI as well</p>
            <p><strong>(c) Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) </strong></p>
            <p>Today, all major regulatory bodies are concerned about customer rights and fair trade. Almost all major regulators across industries have set up robust grievance management and redressal mechanisms to service and protect interests of end customers. The interest of policyholders is on top of the IRDAI’s agenda. These days IRDAI is investing in to execute Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) through automation of the Grievance Cell for on-line registration of complaints. IGMS will act as a gateway for policyholders to register their complaints with the insurance companies first and if required these complaints can then be escalated directly to the IGCC. With IGMS, you can also route your complaint. A complaint registered through IGMS will flow simultaneously to the insurers system as well as to IRDAI repository In fact, a media campaign has been launched in order to educate policyholders and publicise the regulating body’s grievance redressal mechanisms. Another initiative in this direction is the launch of the Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS), a platform to help customers lodge and track their complaints online. Additionally, the regulator also has a grievance cell, besides several Insurance Ombudsman offices. The IGMS put in place by IRDAI is the repository of the insurance industry complaints providing not only a platform to raise customer grievances with insurers but also to generate various, analytical reports on Customer grievances registered against the Insurers. If policyholders are not able to access the insurance company directly for any reason, IGMS provides a gateway to register complaints with insurance companies.</p>
            <p><strong>(d) Government Department of Administration Reforms and Public Grievances (DAPRG)</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance industry is essentially a service industry where, in the present context, customer expectations are constantly rising and dissatisfaction with the standard of services rendered is ever present. Despite there being continuous product innovation and significant improvement in the level of customer service aided by use of modern technology, the industry suffers badly in terms of customer dissatisfaction and poor image. Alive to this situation the government and the regulator have taken a number of initiatives.  Apart from the complaints registered in the IGMS Portal of IRDAI, Complaints registered in DARPG Portal against insurers are also referred to IRDAI. The Insurance regulatory body regularly accesses the portal of the DARPG and ensures that complaints relating to the insurance sector are downloaded and necessary action to get them examined by the insurers is taken.</p>
            <p><strong>(e) Consumer Forums</strong></p>
            <p>The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, was enacted with an objective to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the grievances of consumers. It covers goods and services, unless specifically exempted by the Central Government.  The Act establishes quasi-judicial authorities at the district, state and national levels to deal with consumer grievances. Insurance is one of the services enumerated in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and falls within the purview of the definition of ‘services’ under Sec. 2(1) (0). Insurance being a prime component of financial services, any beneficiary under such contract is considered to be an insurance consumer. The consumer law provides protection to all affected consumer whose insurance services suffer from the deficiencies and defects. The act however restricts the ambit and scope of the power of the consumer court to award compensation to the aggrieved policyholder. And, it is only when there is deficiency in the service rendered to him and he has suffered any loss or injury due to the negligence of the insurer that relief by way of compensation can be granted to him/her. In other words, the consumer is entitled to relief under the act if and only if he establishes that he hired the service complaint of and that the service provided to him has a deficiency. Consumer courts are the last resort for a policyholder. One need not approach the ombudsman before knocking on the consumer courts’ doors, one can do so directly. Approaching the consumer forum would be the simplest, fastest and most economical remedy. The forum is better accessible, and awards compensation and costs.  The insured can also approach consumer forums or civil courts for relief if the insurer fails to comply with the Ombudsman’s order or they are not satisfied with it.</p>
            <p><strong>(f) Arbitration on Quantum</strong></p>
            <p>Arbitration, a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), is a technique for the resolution of disputes outside the Courts, where the parties to a dispute refer it to one or more persons (the arbitrators or arbitral tribunal) by whose decision (the award) they agree to be bound. It is a resolution technique in which a third party reviews the evidence in the case and imposes a decision that is legally binding for both sides and is enforceable. These days, the use of Arbitration
              clause in consumer contracts is on the rise – it is commonly found in consumer contracts for insurance policies, gift redemption offers, or home or car loans from finance companies. The speedy resolution mechanism offered via arbitration as compared to resolution of disputes by Civil Courts makes it a popular choice for Indian Insurance Industry.  In sectors such as insurance the use of arbitration clause has a history. Insurance offerings were once covered by tariffs and required that disputes (largely relating to quantum) be resolved via arbitration. Even as insurance offerings have been de-tariffed since 2007, it is customary to continue with the arbitration clause.</p>
            <p><strong>(g) Lok Adalat</strong></p>
            <p>Lok Adalat literally means “People’s Court”. It is a court for the people, by the people and of the people themselves. It is a special kind of people’s court in which disputes are solved by direct talks between the litigants. In Lok Adalat, the procedural and perfunctory requirements of the proper court are done away with, and the cadaverous remains are fleshed out with flexibility and amenity in settlement, and this lends the Lok Adalat the characteristics of people friendliness. It is a mode of redressing grievances and delivering justice but it has nothing in common with the adjudicating machinery. In fact, Lok Adalats originated from the failure of the Indian Legal System to provide fast, effective and affordable justice. The evolution of this movement was a part of strategy to relieve the heavy burden on the courts with cases pending disposal. The Supreme Court has been promoting this forum as a part of an alternative disputes redressal mechanism to reduce the high pendency of cases in the subordinate courts. The pendency of the cases poses great difficulties to the judiciary and to the people who queue up in the hope of getting justice. Lok Adalat is a boon to litigant public where they can get their disputes settled fast and free of cost.</p>
            <p><strong>(h) Insurance Ombudsman</strong></p>
            <p>The first point of contact for a policyholder should always be the insurer. The traditional role of civil service which was of administrator, service provider and controller of development activities has to make way for the new roles of facilitator and regulator so as to create best environment and conditions in the country for building a nation of excellence. While consumer groups remain apprehensive about the steps being taken by the regulator to protect policyholders’ interests, these moves are definitely a step in the right direction. If a policyholder is unhappy with the company’s response, he can approach the insurance ombudsman in his city 30 days after you first lodged the complaint with the insurer. It is a quasi-judicial body which deals with cases up to a value of Rs 20 lakh and has the power to award compensation to aggrieved policyholders. The ombudsman primarily comes into the picture for complaints that involve monetary compensation; IGMS is the way to go for simpler complaints. The ombudsman framework has turned out to be as helpful as it was expected to be. Unlike the grievance cell, the Ombudsman does have the power to pass orders. Cases of up to Rs 20 lakh fall under the ambit of the Ombudsman’s powers. The Ombudsman addresses issues related to rejection or delay in the settlement of claims, disputes on premiums and non-issuance of a document after collecting the premium. Complaints have to be filed with the Ombudsman office under whose jurisdiction your complaint falls. Recommendations can be made within a month of the receipt of the complaint, while a verdict has to be given within three months. If the need arises, the Ombudsman can also award compensation to the policyholder. The Ombudsman is appointed by the Insurance Council and is supposed to be independent. The order passed by the Ombudsman is binding on the insurance company. It is up to the insured whether to accept the award or to file a consumer complaint if he/she is dissatisfied with such an award. If the verdict is acceptable to the insured, he/she is required to intimate the Ombudsman of this within 15 days.  This requires a paradigm shift in governance to a system where the citizen is in the centre and he is consulted at various stages of formulation and implementation of public policy. To achieve this objective, India needs a public service which is capable, innovative and forward looking.</p>

            <h3 id="five3">AML/KYC Norms</h3>
            <p><strong>(A) Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance for Insurance Companies</strong></p>
            <p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 brought into force with effect from 1st July2005 (amended from time to time). The act is applicable to all the financial institutions which include insurance companies: Life and Non-Life, Public Sector and private Sector. Insurance companies that issue or underwrite covered products that may pose a higher risk of money laundering must comply with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) program requirements. A covered product includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An annuity contract other than a group annuity contract</li>
              <li>A permanent life insurance policy other than a group life insurance policy</li>
              <li>Any other insurance product with cash value or investment features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Insurance regulations only apply to insurance companies, excluding agents and brokers from the requirements. However, insurance companies are held responsible for compliance with their program, which includes the activities of any agents and brokers. Insurance companies should therefore integrate their agents and brokers into their AML program.</p>
            <p><strong>Features of a BSA/AML Program</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance companies must develop a written, risk-based BSA/AML program addressing the covered insurance products. At a minimum, the program must consist of the following features,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A designated compliance officer responsible for effectively implementing the program</li>
              <li>Ongoing training of appropriate persons, including insurance agents and brokers</li>
              <li>Policies, procedures and internal controls tailored to the AML risks of the institution</li>
              <li>Independent testing to monitor ongoing compliance, including testing for compliance of insurance agents and brokers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)</strong></p>
            <p>Along with implementing an adequate BSA/AML program, insurance companies are subject to Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements. Companies are required to submit a SAR to the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Insurance companies must obtain relevant customer information from agents, brokers and any other sources to report such transactions. The following are the list of suspicious activity that must be reported</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Customer insisting on anonymity, reluctance to provide identifying information, or providing minimal, seemingly fictitious information</li>
              <li>Cash based suspicious transactions for payment / multiple DDs each denominated for less than Rs. 50,000/-</li>
              <li>Overpayment of premiums with a request for a refund of the amount overpaid</li>
              <li>Request for a purchase of policy in amount considered beyond his apparent need;</li>
              <li>Unusual terminating of policies and refunds;</li>
              <li>Inflated or totally fraudulent claims e.g. by arson or other means causing a fraudulent claim made to recover part of the invested illegitimate funds.</li>
              <li>Policy from a place where he does not reside or is employed.</li>
              <li>Borrowing the maximum amount against a policy soon after buying it</li>
              <li>Frequent free look surrenders by customers</li>
              <li>Frequent request for change in addresses</li>
              <li>Assignments to unrelated parties without valid consideration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Special attention is paid to all complex, unusually large transactions and all unusual patterns which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose and transactions. Background including all documents /office records /memorandums pertaining to such transactions, as far as possible, be examined by the Principal Compliance officer for recording his/her findings. Operating offices through Nodal Officer of Regional Office should report the suspicious transactions to FIU-IND within 7 working days of identification in the prescribed formats under advice to Principal Compliance Officer at Head Office. Directors, officers and employees (permanent and temporary) shall be prohibited from disclosing the fact that a SAR or related information of a policyholder/prospect is being reported or provided to the FIU-IND.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas of Concern to Review</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance companies face the challenge of developing an AML program that incorporates insurance agents and brokers, and effectively covers the risks proportionate to its specific products offered. Any areas of concern can be addressed by conducting the following reviews</p>
            <p><strong>Policies and Procedures: </strong> Evaluate policies and procedures to determine adequacy given the institutions’ risks and current industry regulatory requirements</p>
            <p><strong>AML Risk Assessments:</strong>Assess the inherent and residual AML risks related to products, services, customers and geographic exposure</p>
            <p><strong>Model Validations and AML Automated System Data Validation: </strong>Determine if the appropriate AML models and systems are effectively implemented</p>
            <p><strong>Independent Audits: </strong>Conduct independent reviews and detailed AML transactional testing to ensure the program’s ongoing compliance</p>
            <p><strong>Training:</strong> Review staff training programs to ensure adequate coverage of relevant responsibilities under the program</p>
            <p><strong>Risk-Based Review: </strong>Determine and assess the total effectiveness of AML-related processes and internal controls in relation to the specific products, services, customers and geographies of the company, including staffing levels and expertise, customer due diligence processes, effectiveness of the monitoring processes in place to identify and report suspicious activities, and the integration of insurance agents and brokers into the program</p>
            <p><strong>Independent/Outsourced Due Diligence and Sanctions Screening: </strong>Identify beneficial ownership structures, negative news and sanctions screening for customers, vendors and transaction parties</p>
            <p><strong>Products Exempted from AML Purview</strong></p>
            <p>The following categories of products/business lines may be exempted from the purview of AML requirements,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standalone medical/health insurance products.</li>
              <li>Reinsurance and retrocession contracts</li>
              <li>Group insurance businesses issued to a company, financial institution, or association.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(B) Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance regulator IRDAI has issued Anti Money Laundering (AML) guidelines that include strict adherence of KYC norms by insurance companies. The AML makes it mandatory for insurers to comply with 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) norms by obtaining documents to clearly establish the customer identity in case of all new insurance contracts. Where premium is Rs 1 lakh per annum in case of individual policies, a detailed due diligence should be exercised to establish KYC </p>
            Three Criteria
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Identification of name</li>
              <li>Identification of residence</li>
              <li>Identification of source of funds / net worth.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Exercising KYC Norms</strong></p>
            <p>A list of documents to be verified at the time of accepting the risk / payout or refund more than INR one lac for compliance with KYC requirement for individuals and others is prescribed as per the guidelines. Further, the insurer would not enter into a contract with a customer whose identity matches with any person with known criminal background or with banned entities and those reported to have links with terrorists or terrorist organizations</p>
            <p>Documents that may be obtained from customers</p>

            <h3 id="five4">Point of Sale (POS) Persons</h3>
            <p>To increase insurance penetration in the country, the industry needs more distributors to travel the last mile. To achieve that goal, what’s needed is a simple certification process for these distributors. So, to get such distributors on board quickly, the IRDAI, in 2015, allowed for a new type of distributor, called the point of sale (POS) person. Given that these individuals have a lower qualification and training threshold, compared to other insurance distributors such as agents, brokers and corporate agents, IRDAI has allowed these individuals to sell only basic insurance products, which do not require a lot of underwriting.</p>
            <p><strong>Mandate of a POS Person </strong></p>
            <p>As per the regulator, products such as motor insurance, travel insurance and personal accident insurance require very little underwriting as they are based on information provided by the prospect. Also, such insurance policies are automatically generated by the system. Therefore, the intervention required for such products is minimal and the training and exams for such persons could be of a lesser degree than those for a full-fledged distributor. In fact, in November 2017, IRDAI had allowed the life insurance industry to use point of sale persons to sell life insurance products. For this, it identified products that are simple to understand, and in which the benefits are stated upfront and they are fixed and predefined. Accordingly, IRDAI identified pure-term insurance plans with and without return of premium, non-linked (non-participating) endowment plans that state the investment benefits upfront and immediate annuity as products that can be sold by the POS persons. And this year, in order to ensure faster certification of POS persons, the regulator has relaxed the certification programme by allowing the insurers or intermediaries hiring them to train and examine these individuals in-house. </p>
            <p><strong>A New Training Programme</strong></p>
            <p>POS persons can be engaged either directly by insurers or by intermediaries such as corporate agents and insurance brokers. The new POS guidelines allow intermediary players in the insurance sector such as brokers giving comparative insurance rates to appoint agents to work on their behalf. Under previous guidelines, only insurers could appoint dedicated agents for their business and one agent could sell policies only for one company. On the other hand, POS certified agents of brokers are allowed to solicit and sell retail insurance products for various insurance companies on the condition that they should already be pre-underwritten. This for example includes motor insurance, simple health insurance and travel insurance. As per the latest guidelines, brokers with online comparison portals can now have agents working for them. What this primarily means is that apart from their primary platform that is – online sales, these intermediaries can now also have offline sales agents to push sales in under penetrated markets. All the benefits of the online platform such as lower rates, hassle free policy issuance, on the spot policy issuance etc can now be made available through a robust combination of physical agents and digital technology. This will lead to easier availability of auto insurance, say for example, in a petrol pump or a neighborhood store. Easier availability and sufficient push from insurers/intermediaries will also improve insurance renewal and policy issuance, especially in the two-wheeler segment. In the latest move to promote further insurance penetration, IRDAI has also allowed insurance intermediaries such as brokers to sponsor the training and certification of POS agents. Allowing intermediaries to appoint POS persons to sell retail insurance will ensure greater adherence to insurance requirements as well as improve insurance density by making policy purchase extremely convenient and easily available. </p>
            <p>The minimum educational qualification of such persons is Class 10 and they should be 18 years of age at least. Earlier, as per the rules, IRDAI had appointed the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) to conduct the examination of certificate for point of sale persons. But in a notification dated 7 February, IRDAI removed this condition for the life insurance industry. Training and certification from NIELIT is no longer mandatory. As per an insurance official, this was done after representations were made to the regulator that this could hamper quick on-boarding of point of sales persons. Accordingly, IRDAI has allowed in-house training by the insurer or intermediary engaging the POS persons. They will have to conduct an in-house training of 15 hours and an examination thereafter. The insurer or the intermediary will then issue a certificate and maintain the records for at least 5 years. IRDAI has, however, prescribed a model syllabus for training purposes. As per the insurers we spoke to, the syllabus has been drafted by the Life Insurance Council and IRDAI, and will be used by all the insurers.</p>
            <p><strong>Products Solicited and Marketed by POS Person</strong></p>
            <p>The POS person can sell only the following pre-underwritten product. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Motor comprehensive insurance package policy for two-wheeler, private car and commercial vehicles.</li>

            <p>Every policy sold through the POS person shall be separately identified and pre-fixed by the name POS – (name of product). The insurance company shall file the product with the Authority under the file use guidelines for information.</p>
            <p>IRDAI has received requests from many insurers to allow indemnity based health insurance products to be sold through POS. On examination of the request made, the authority under the powers vested with it under clause V(1)(f), of the said guidelines, has decided to allow individual indemnity based health insurance products to be solicited through PoS channel with the following conditions,</p>
            <ul>

              <p><strong>KEY POINTS</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is incumbent upon the insurers on continuous basis to have in place an independent and transparent grievance redress machinery to resolve grievances in conformity with Redress of Public Grievances Rules, 1998. Apart from this, Regulation 5 of the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders Interests) Regulations, 2006, stipulate that every insurer shall have in place, proper procedures and effective mechanism to address complaints and grievances of policyholders efficiently and with speed</li>
                <li>Every company has instituted an in-house grievance settlement procedure. And the policyholders who have a complaint against the insurer are required to first approach the Grievance/Customer Complaint Cell of the concerned insurer.</li>
                <li>IRDAI has established its own grievance cell at its headquarter for discontented insurance customers. A recent introduction by IRDAI for the facilitation of policyholder is IRDAI Grievance Call Centre (IGCC). IGCC acts as an additional and easily accessible channel for policy holders to lodge their grievances and also seek their status over phone/email</li>
                <li>IGMS will act as a gateway for policyholders to register their complaints with the insurance companies first and if required these complaints can then be escalated directly to the IRDAI Grievance Cell</li>
                <li>Apart from the complaints registered in the IGMS Portal of IRDAI, Complaints registered in DARPG Portal against insurers are also referred to IRDAI.</li>
                <li>The consumer law provides protection to all affected consumer whose insurance services suffer from the deficiencies and defects. The act however restricts the ambit and scope of the power of the consumer court to award compensation to the aggrieved policyholder</li>
                <li>These days, the use of arbitration clause in consumer contracts is on the rise – it is commonly found in consumer contracts for insurance policies, gift redemption offers, or home or car loans from finance companies.</li>
                <li>If a policyholder is unhappy with the company’s response, he can approach the insurance ombudsman in his city 30 days after you first lodged the complaint with the insurer. It is a quasi-judicial body which deals with cases up to a value of Rs 20 lakh and has the power to award compensation to aggrieved policyholders.</li>
                <li>In a major move to protect consumer interests and curb malpractices in India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (‘IRDAI’), on 30 June 2017, notified the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2017, which supersedes the existing IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002. </li>
                <li>Every insurer shall place in its website the terms and conditions of every insurance product that is offered for sale by the insurer as it was approved by the authority under file and use procedure or filed with the authority under use and file procedure, including products modified or products withdrawn.</li>
                <li>Except in cases of a marine insurance cover, where current market practices do not insist on a written proposal form, in all cases, a proposal for grant of a cover, either for life business or for general business, must be evidenced by a written document</li>
                <li>A request received by insurer for free look cancellation of the policy shall be processed and premium refunded within 15 days of receipt of the request.</li>
                <li>Every insurer shall inform and keep informed periodically the insured on the requirements to be fulfilled by the insured regarding lodging of a claim arising in terms of the policy and the procedures to be followed by him to enable the insurer to settle a claim early.</li>
                <li>Matters to be stated in life insurance, general insurance and health insurance as well as claims procedures related to life, general and health insurance has been specified the Protection of Policyholders Interest Regulations, 2017, which all insurers must follow</li>
                <li>The policyholder shall furnish all information that is sought from him by the insurer and also any other information which the insurer considers as having a bearing on the risk to enable the latter to assess properly the risk sought to be covered by a policy</li>
                <li>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 brought into force with effect from 1st July 2005 (amended from time to time). The act is applicable to all the financial institutions which include insurance companies: Life and Non-Life, Public Sector and private Sector. Insurance companies must develop a written, risk-based BSA/AML program addressing the covered insurance products.</li>
                <li>Along with implementing an adequate BSA/AML program, insurance companies are subject to Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements. Companies are required to submit a SAR to the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.</li>
                <li>Insurance regulator IRDAI has issued Anti Money Laundering (AML) guidelines that include strict adherence of KYC norms by insurance companies. The AML makes it mandatory for insurers to comply with 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) norms by obtaining documents to clearly establish the customer identity in case of all new insurance contracts.</li>
                <li>PoS persons can be engaged either directly by insurers or by intermediaries such as corporate agents and insurance brokers.</li>
                <li>Accordingly, IRDAI has allowed in-house training by the insurer or intermediary engaging the point of sale persons. They will have to conduct an in-house training of 15 hours and an examination thereafter</li>
                <li>For sales effected through the insurance intermediary, the insurance intermediary shall record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN card number or the PoS person in the proposal form and require insurance company to do the same in the insurance policy</li>

            <h2 id="six">SYNOPSIS</h2>
            <h3 id="six1">Introduction to Insurance</h3>
            <p>This material explains the meaning of risk, different types of risks and the risk management techniques that can be used to reduce losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Peril:</strong>An event or incident that may cause a loss is caused a peril. Insurance cannot avoid or stop an event from happening. It can only help compensate the losses. Insurance can compensate only financial losses. Examples of Peril, Fire, Flood, Earthquakes, Landslide, lightening.</p>
            <p><strong>Classification of Risks</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Catastrophic – Single event leads to higher than usual number/amount of claims on the insurer</li>
              <li>Financial risks- Loss from risk can be quantified in monetary terms</li>
              <li>Non financial risks- loss from risk cannot be measured in monetary terms</li>
              <li>Dynamic risk- Risks resulting from changes in the economy</li>
              <li>Static risks- Loss from risk due to perils of nature and dishonesty of other individuals</li>
              <li>Pure risks- These risks are not under the control of the person</li>
              <li>Speculative risk- In these risks there is a chance of gain or loss</li>
              <li>Fundamental risks- These risks affect a lot of people together</li>
              <li>Particular risks- These risks affect only specific persons </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hazard: </strong>Hazard is a condition that increases the chance of risk.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Physical Hazard refers to characteristics and qualities of subject matter to be insured.</li>
              <li>Moral Hazard refers to the character of the person approaching for insurance</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Risk Management </strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Prevent/avoid the risk</li>
              <li>Reduce the risk</li>
              <li>Retain the risk </li>
              <li>Transfer the risk</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Risk management formally evolved a function of business enterprise but applies to individual risk. An individual can transfer risk on his life to an insurance company by purchasing life insurance policy.</p>
            <h3 id="six2">Concept of Insurance</h3>
            <p>An insurance company (referred to usually as the insurer) promises to pay to the owner (insured) or beneficiary of the asset, a certain sum of money (sum assured),if   a loss occurs to ensure continuance of the financial benefits. The insured pays a certain amount (consideration) to the insurance company for bearing the risk, which is known as a premium. The business of insurance is related to the protection of the economic value of the assets. An asset is valuable for the owners because they get benefit s from it in the form of a comfort and convenience.</p>
            <p><strong>Evolution of Insurance</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance evolved in India in 18th Century. In 1818, the Oriental Life Insurance company was the first life Insurance company to start insurance operations in Calcutta.</p>
            <p><strong>How Insurance Works and Concept of Pooling</strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>People exposed to similar risk are brought together</li>
              <li>Insurance company acts as an intermediary</li>
              <li>Mutual consent among group members to share the loss and compensate the person who suffered the loss</li>
              <li>Compensation is expected to put the person in the same place, financially, as before suffering the loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Insurance Contract</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance is a contract between two parties the insurance company and the policyholder. The insurance policy would specify the following</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The  risk which is the subject matter of the contract</li>
              <li>The event upon which the liability of the insurer would arise </li>
              <li>The nature of liability of the insurer , the amount and the manner of payment</li>
              <li>The amount and the manner of payment of premium by the policyholder</li>
              <li>Other obligations if any of the policyholder</li>
              <li>Consequences of any obligations by the policyholder</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Principle of Insurable interest </strong></p>
            <p>A person is said to have an insurable interest when they stand to gain or benefit from the continued existence (safety) and well being of the person or property insured and would suffer a financial loss if there is damage to the person or property.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Indemnity </strong></p>
            <p>Insurance is meant to indemnify/compensate the losses. Accordingly to the principle of indemnity, insurance should place the insured in the same financial position after the loss,  as they enjoyed before it, not better. The principle of indemnity makes sure that the insurance company compensates the insured only to the extent of the loss so that the insured does not profit from insurance.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Subrogation</strong></p>
            <p>The substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim, demand or right, so that he or she who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to the debt or claim, and its rights, remedies or securities. Subrogation ensues having paid the claim, the insurance company gets the right to make good the damages from the party who caused the loss. Having been indemnified by the insurer, the insured does not retain the right to get compensated by the party who caused the loss and thus makes profit from insurance. Subrogation ensures insurance company is entitled to recover money from the third party but only to the extent it has paid as compensation to the insured person.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Contribution</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of contribution ensures that if there is more than one insurance policy drawn up  on the same subject matter, the insured cannot recover their loss from all the insurers , in which case they will recover more  than their loss, or even make a profit.</p>
            <p>Contribution</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The insured does not profit by making separate claims rom multiple companies for the same event.</li>
              <li>Each insurer pays only their proportionate share of the loss.</li>
              <li>The principles of subrogation and contribution apply only to contracts of indemnity. So the two principles do not apply for Life Insurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Principle of Utmost Good faith</strong></p>
            <p>As per the principle of utmost good faith, the proposer is obliged to declare all relevant facts that are material to the assessment of the risk, at the time of making the proposal. This information is important for the insurer in deciding whether to accept the proposal and the appropriate premium to be charged. </p>
            <p><strong>Material Facts</strong></p>
            <p>A fact is said to be material, if it affects the decision of the underwriter to accept or reject the risk or to determine rates, terms, and conditions if the risk is accepted. That is, if that “fact” is relevant to the assessment of the risk and determination of the premium.</p>
            <p>Principle of Utmost good faith will be breached, by giving wrong information and by not disclosing material facts. The Insurance Company should declare all the relevant information and benefits of the product to the customer. </p>
            <p><strong>Proximate Cause </strong></p>
            <p>Proximate cause is defined as the active and efficient cause that sets in motion a chain of events which brings about a result, without the intervention of any force started and working actively from a new and independent source. . The dominant, effective or operative cause of an event is known as the proximate cause.</p>
            <h3 id="six3">Term that Apply to Life and Non-Life insurance</h3>

            <p>Hospitalisation indemnity plans offered for Individuals, as a family floater and also as a group.  Typically theses plans reimburse the following expenses.</p>

            <ol type="1">

              <li> Specialists’ fees. Surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s fee for in patient and day care procedures</li>
              <li> Physicians fees for  in-patient treatment</li>
              <li> Cost of medicines, diagnostic test etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Pre-existing conditions ( conditions the insured had before taking out the insurance)are usually excluded from coverage for a defined period (in 2008, the General Insurance Council  decided to cap the waiting period for pr existing conditions to 4 yeas). These products generally exclude the following.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li> Drug abuse</li>
              <li> Self inflicted injuries</li>

              <li>Maternity and termination of pregnancy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Usually the condition for eligibility for this benefit payment is that the insured has to be hospitalised for atleast 24 hours  This is however, waived for certain defined day care surgical procedures where due to technological  advancement, the patient can undergo surgery and be discharged on the same day.  In these policies, pre hospitalisation and post hospitalisation also covered with capping on no of days.  For example pre hospitalisation expenses for 30 days and post hospitalisation expenses for 60 days covered and policy conditions spell these benefits with clarity.  Recently these products have seen the introduction of many cost sharing provisions like,</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Sub limits on specific surgeries, ailments, components of the hospital costs.</li>
              <li> Co payments (also called co insurance)  where a defined share of the costs are borne by the insured and</li>
              <li> Deductible ( also called excess)  where the initial  defined amount , of hospital costs are borne by the policyholder  after which the coverage starts.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="one12">INTRODUCTION TO INSURANCE</h2>
            <p align="justify">Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss. That is, promise of compensation for specific potential future losses in exchange for a periodic payment. Insurance is designed to protect the financial well-being of an individual, company or other entity against unexpected or unpredictable losses or expenses. An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance agent or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or a policyholder. Insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss</p>
            <h3 id="one11">Functions of Insurance</h3>
            <p align="justify">Functions of insurance can be divided into parts;</p>
            <ol type="I">
              <li>Primary functions.</li>
              <li>Secondary functions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Primary Functions</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Certainty of Compensation of Loss:</strong> Insurance provides certainty of payment at the uncertainty of loss. The elements of uncertainty are reduced by better planning and administration. The insurer charges premium for providing certainty.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance Provides Protection:</strong>The main function of insurance is to provide protection against risk of loss.

            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk Sharing:</strong>All business concerns face the problem of risk. Risk and insurance are interlinked with each other. Insurance, as a device is the outcome of the existence of various risks in our day to day life. It does not eliminate risks but it reduces the financial loss caused by risks. Insurance spreads the whole loss over the large number of persons who are exposed by a particular risk.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Functions</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Prevention of Losses:</strong>The insurance companies help in prevention of losses as they join hands with those institutions which are engaged in loss prevention measures. The reduction in losses means that the insurance companies would be required to pay lesser compensations to the assured and manage to accumulate more savings, which in turn, will assist in reducing the premiums</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Providing funds for investment:</strong>Insurance provide capital for society. Accumulated funds through savings in the form of insurance premium are invested in economic development plans or productivity projects.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance increases efficiency:</strong>The insurance eliminates the worries and miseries of losses. A person can devote his time to other important matters for better achievement of goals. Businessman feel more motivated and encouraged to take risks to enhance their profit earning. This also helps in improving their efficiencies.</p>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Encouragement of savings:</strong>Insurance not only provides protection against risks but also a number of other incentives which encourages people to insure. Since regularity and punctuality pf payment of premium is a perquisite for keeping the policy in force, the insured feels compelled to save.</p>
            <h3 id="one21">Purpose and Need for Insurance</h3>
            <p align="justify">The world we live in is full of uncertainties and risks. Individuals, families, businesses, properties and assets are exposed to different types and levels of risks. These include risk of losses of life, health, assets, property, and so on. While it is not always possible to prevent unwanted events from occurring, financial world has developed products that protect individuals and businesses against such losses by compensating them with financial resources. Insurance is a financial product that reduces or eliminates the cost of loss or effect of loss caused by different types of risks. Insurance is a shield which protects the financial interests of you and your family in case of unseen and unpredicted circumstances.
            </p>
            <h4>Benefits to Individual</h4>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Capital Formation:</strong> As institutional investors, insurance companies provide funds for financing economic development. They mobilize the saving of the people and invest these saving into more productive channels</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Generating Employment Opportunities:</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Promoting Social Welfare:</strong>Policies like old age pension scheme, policies for education, marriage provide sense of security to the policyholders and thus ensure social welfare.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Helps Controlling Inflation:</strong> The insurance reduces the inflationary pressure in two ways, first, by extracting money in supply to the amount of premium collected and secondly, by providing funds for production narrow down the inflationary gap.</p>

              <li>Life Insurance</li>
              <li>General Insurance</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Life Insurance</strong> pays the insured/policy holder or your beneficiaries a certain sum of money in case of your death.

            <p>The insurance can be classified into three categories from risk point of view</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Property Insurance</li>
              <li>Liability Insurance</li>
              <li>Other forms of Insurance</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Property Insurance:</strong></p>

            </ul>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Fire Insurance:</strong>Fire insurance covers risks of fire. It is contract of indemnity. Fire insurance is a
              contract under which the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured, in return for payment of the
              premium in lump sum or by installments, losses suffered by the insured due to destruction of or
              damage to the insured property, caused by fire during an agreed period of time. It includes losses
              directly caused through fire or ignition.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Marine Insurance:</strong>Marine insurance is an arrangement by which the insurer undertakes to
              compensate the owner of the ship or cargo for complete or partial loss at sea. So it provides
              protection against loss because of marine perils. The marine perils are collisions with rock, ship
              attack by enemies, fire etc. Marine insurance insures ship, cargo and freight.</p>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Miscellaneous Insurance:</strong>It includes various forms of insurance including property insurance,
              liability insurance, personal injuries are also insured. The property, goods, machine, furniture,
              automobile, valuable goods etc. can be insured against the damage or destruction due to accident
              or disappearance due to theft. Miscellaneous insurance covers</p>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Proposer/Insured:</strong>  A proposer is a person or a firm who proposes for insurance cover to the insurance company.
              Once a proposal along with the premium is accepted by the insurance company a contract in to
              the form of a policy comes into existence. The proposal for insurance cannot be made by any
              person. A person who is the owner of a property or has a financial interest in the property can
              only propose for insurance. For example, in motor insurance only a registered owner of the
              vehicle or a bank/financier who has financed the vehicle can only propose for insurance.</p>
            <p align="justify"><Strong>Insurer/Insurance Company:</Strong> An individual or company who, through a contractual agreement, undertakes to compensate specified losses, liability, or damages incurred by another individual is known as the
              insurer/insurance company. An insurer is frequently an insurance company and is also known as
              an underwriter. An insurance company or the insurer in the Indian context is a duly registered
              Indian company to transact the general or life insurance business in India by the Government of
              India through its registering authority Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(IRDA).</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Beneficiary</strong>Beneficiary is the one whom the insured or policy holder has nominated for the insured amount in
              case of your death. Beneficiary are of two types: revocable beneficiary and irrevocable
              beneficiary. Revocable beneficiary’ designation gives right to the policy holder to change the
              beneficiary name without the consent of the named beneficiary. While in irrevocable beneficiary
              the policy holder has to take consent of the beneficiary before the name is changed.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Proposal Form</strong> Proposal form is the most important and basic document required for life insurance contract
              between the insured and insurance company This is a prescribed form required to be submitted
              duly signed and duly filled up along with the premium by the proposer proposing insurance to the
              office of the insurer directly or online or through its intermediaries like insurance agent or
              insurance broker. It includes the insured's fundamental information such as name, age, address,
              education, occupation, and so on. It also includes the person's medical history. Separate proposal
              forms are prescribed by the insurer for various types of insurance covers. Proposal form is the
              basis of insurance contract and concealment of material information or wrong information can
              lead to rejection of insurance claim.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Sum Insured</strong> Sum insured is the amount of money that an insurance company is obligated to cover in the event
              of a covered loss. It is the insurer's limit of liability under an insurance contract. Sum insured
              represents the sum for which insurance is required by the proposer and agreed by the insurer. It
              should represent the present market value of the subject matter of insurance. This is mentioned in
              the cover note and subsequently in the policy document by the insurer. The sum insured amount is
              dependent upon the premium price that is being paid for the insurance coverage. The sum insured
              is taken into consideration by insurer at the time of claim settlement.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Premium</strong>An insurance premium is the amount of money that an individual or business must pay for an
              insurance policy. Premium is an amount paid periodically to the insurer by the insured for
              covering his risk. The insurance premium is income for the insurance company, once it is earned,
              and also represents a liability in that the insurer must provide coverage for claims being made
              against the policy. The amount of premium varies and depends upon the premium rate, sum
              insured, subject matter of insurance, the perils covered, hazards involved, the past loss experience
              and terms and conditions of insurance. Premium can be paid by proposer or policy holder either
              by cash, cheque, bank draft, bank pay order, credit/debit card,Internet or e-transfer or direct credit
              through bank transfer or through bank guarantee or cash deposit.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Surrender Value and Paid Up Value</strong>Surrender value is the sum of money an insurance company pays to a policyholder in the event
              that his or her policy is voluntarily terminated before its maturity or an insured event occurs. The
              policy ceases as soon as the insured/policy holder withdraws the money, and the insured will lose
              out all the returns on it. A mid-term surrender would result in the policyholder getting a sum of
              what has been allocated towards savings and the earnings thereon. Paid-up value is the reduced
              amount of sum assured paid by the insurance company, in case the policyholder discontinues
              payment of premiums. After payment of three years of premium in traditional life insurance
              plans, your policy automatically acquires paid-up value. The sum assured by the insurance
              company is reduced proportionally depending when insured has stopped paying the premium.
              The insured or policy holder will get the amount at the end of the term.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong>No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a discount, given by an insurer to a policyholder for making no claims
              during the policy term. NCB can be accumulated over years and the discount ranges from 20
              percent to 50 percent on the own damage premium. No claim bonus is a benefit for those who
              have not claimed insurance during the preceding year of cover. This discount increases every
              year, provided, the claim has not been made yet. This will lower the premium on the following
              year. However, the discount rates are dependent on the age of the policy and when the last claim
              was made. NCB is applicable only on the own damage premium. It is not applicable on either the
              third-party liability premium or the add-on coverage.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance Coverage</strong>Insurance coverage means, when an individual takes an insurance policy the insured will be
              covered by insurance company for a specific amount for themselves or the things that he had
              taken the insurance policy, for which he would be paying premiums to the insurance company.
              The insurance company will pay the insured in case of damage or claims made by the insured
              according to their insurance coverage.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Policy</strong>Policy is a valid stamped document duly signed and issued by the authorised representative of the
              insurer as a proof of contract to the insured. It is generally an integrated contract, meaning that it
              includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and insurer. It contains
              schedule showing the name and address of insured and details of property insured. Policy also
              contains amount of premium paid, all the conditions, warranties and exclusions applicable to the
              contract besides the period of insurance with the date and time of commencement, and date and
              time of expiry, details of perils covered. In life insurance, policy also has a mention regarding
              name of nominee & date of maturity.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Premium Receipt</strong> It is a receipt of premium issued by the office of the insurer to the proposer/insured in token of
              having received the premium.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Certificate of Insurance</strong>A certificate of insurance is a document used to provide information on specific insurance
              coverage. The certificate provides verification of the insurance and usually contains information
              on types and limits of coverage, insurance company, policy number, named insured, and the
              policies’ effective periods. Although the certificate should not be substituted for information
              contained in the actual insurance policies, it is usually a reliable source of information or proof of
              insurance coverage. In motor insurance along with the policy an additional document is issued by
              the insurer as a proof of insurance of the vehicle, as required in the motor vehicles act and is
              known as certificate of insurance. This is required to be kept in person while driving the vehicle
              and is to be shown to the police authorities if asked for.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Cover Note</strong>A cover note is a temporary a numbered document issued by an insurance or a duly authorised
              representative pending issue of policy document to the insured in non-life insurance. A cover note
              is different from a certificate of insurance or an insurance policy document. A cover note features
              the name and address of the insured, the insurer, date and time of issue, period of cover, premium,
              and what is being covered by the insurance. It remains valid for the period of insurance until it is
              replaced by the policy document</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Endorsements</strong>Endorsements are the documents issued by the insurer after the issue of the policy to correct, add,
              delete, and make amendments in the policy at the instance of the insurer or the insured.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Contestable Period and Declaration Page</strong>Contestable period is usually 1 or 2 years, during which the insurance company holds all the rightto investigate the policy and decide whether to pay or not to pay to the insured. Declaration page’
              in insurance policy, bears all the information of the policy holder like name, address, vehicle
              information, type of coverage and loss payee information.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Claim</strong>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for
              a covered loss or policy event. In the event of claim under the policy, immediate intimation in
              writing by a letter is required to be given by insured to office of insurance company informing the
              policy number, name of insured, vehicle registration number (in case of motor insurance) date of
              accident, place of accident, nature of loss, cause of loss/damage. The insurance company validates
              the claim and, once approved, issues payment to the insured or an approved interested party on
              behalf of the insured. Insured should submit the duly completed and signed claim form,
              documents with a covering letter to insurance company and should always obtain
              acknowledgement from insurance company on photo copy of covering letter, for receipt of
              documents. If original documents are given to insurance company then a photo copy of claim
              form and all documents should be kept by insured for his record.<p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Renewal Notice</strong> Normally all the policies in general insurance are issued for a period of one year from the date of
              insurance except in the case of fire insurance of buildings used for residential purposes and some
              personal accident policies which can be issued on long term basis by the insurer. The date and
              time of expiry of the cover is mentioned in the policy and insurer is not liable for any untoward
              happening after the policy has lapsed. The insurers as a routine are not required to send the
              renewal notice to the insured in advance regarding the date of expiry of the policy, though
              insurance companies do send SMS and Email as a reminder for renewal of the existing policy. It
              is the duty of the insured to keep the track of his general insurance policies and arrange the
              renewal of the policy through the office of the insurer or his duly authorised representative by
              remitting the renewal premium before the expiry date positively if the insured wants to continue
              the cover.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk, Peril and Hazard</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">The words risk, peril, and hazard may seem interchangeable, but they have distinct definitions in
              the insurance and risk management world</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Risk</strong> Insurance replaces the uncertainty of risk with a guarantee that reduces the adverse effects of risk.
              Risk can be defined as the "uncertainty regarding a loss." Losses, such as auto damage due to an
              accident or negligence regarding your property, can give rise to a liability risk. The loss involved
              with these risks is the lessening or disappearance of value. Risk is the likelihood that an insured
              event will occur, requiring the insurer to pay a claim. For example, in life insurance, the insurance
              risk is the possibility that the insured party will die before his/her premiums equal or exceed the
              death benefit. Insurance companies compensate for this risk by adjusting premium according to
              how great the risk is. The process of analyzing exposures that create risk and designing programs
              to handle them is called risk management</p>
            <p align="justify">A risk that conforms to the norms and specifications of the insurance policy in such a way that the
              criterion for insurance is fulfilled is called insurable risk. There are various essential conditions
              that need to be fulfilled before acceptance of insurability of any risk. In order that a risk be
              insurable the following requirements must be met</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The loss to be insured against must be important enough to warrant the existence of an
                insurance contract</li>
              <li>Risk must permit a reasonable statistical estimate of the chance of loss in order to determine
                the amount of premium to be paid</li>
              <li>The loss should be definite as to cause, time, place and amount</li>
              <li>The loss is not catastrophic</li>
              <li>Risk is accidental in nature</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="justify">For example, the probability (or chance) that a certain vehicle will be involved in an accident in
              year2011 (out of the total vehicle insured that year 2011) can be determined from the number of
              vehicles that were involved in accidents in each of some previous years (out of the total vehicle
              insured those years). The probability (or chance) that a man (or woman) of a certain age will die
              in the ensuring year can be estimated by the fraction of people of that age that died in each of
              some previous. The insurance company also must be able to come up with a reasonable price for
              the insurance. In case of a scenario where the loss is too huge that no insurer would want to pay
              for it, the risk is said to be uninsurable. A risk may not be termed as insurable if it is
              immeasurable, very large, certain or not definable.</p>
            <p align="justify">A risk that cannot be insured, either because the probability of a loss is too high, or because it
              cannot be measured actuarially is uninsurable risk. Uninsurable risk is a condition that poses
              unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would be against the law. Insurance
              companies limit their losses by not taking on certain risks that are very likely to result in a loss.
              Uninsurable risks are those that would bring down an insurance pool, so they cannot be taken on
              for regular coverage. The basic concept of insurance is that it spreads risk among a large group of
              people, so they can protect against a large loss by making a small insurance payment. Insurance
              companies decline to take on non-insurable risks because they know they will almost certainly
              lose money very quickly if they do. In other words, assuming risk with such a high probability of
              loss is bad business. For example, a life insurance company may deem a person who is 70 years
              old and has lung cancer a non-insurable risk because the likelihood of their death before the
              policy becomes profitable is simply too high.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Prill</strong> Peril is a specific risk or cause of loss covered by an insurance policy. A peril is an event or
              circumstance that causes or may potentially cause a loss. Examples of perils include fire,
              flooding, hailstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, auto accidents, or home accidents, such as falling. A
              named-peril policy covers the policyholder only for the risks named in the policy in contrast to an
              all-risk policy, which covers all causes of loss except those specifically excluded</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Hazard</strong> Insurance hazard means the condition or situations that are likely to increases the chances of a
              loss arising from a peril. The probability of happening of the undesired event may become more
              certain or prominent if the subject-matter of insurance presents some peculiar characteristics
              facilitating the causation of the event. Sometimes the causation of the event may not be due to
              some peculiar characteristics of the subject matter itself but may be due to the peculiar character
              of the insured. Whatever it is, this hazard, in fact, indicates a danger (or risk), which danger
              influences the possible happening of the insured event, that is to say, which indicates the
              aggravation of the risk so as to make it somewhat different than normal. There are two elements
              to hazard that an insurers needs to carefully consider, that is, the physical hazard and the moral
              hazard. Both contribute to the chance of a loss.</p>
            <p align="justify">Moral hazards are concerned with the attitude and conduct of people. They indicate those dangers
              which relate to character, integrity and mental attitude of the insured. They are losses that result
              from dishonesty or indifference. Insurance companies suffer losses because of fraudulent or
              inflated claims. These are not visible and cannot be identified by mere inspection of the risk or
              subject of insurance. In every risk, an element of moral hazard may be to some degree, always
              present. For example, carelessness is the cause of most of the accidents and when the insured
              behaves carelessly, an unsatisfactory moral hazard is created; excessive over insurance is
              apparently an instance of bad moral hazard; a very unsatisfactory moral hazard exists when a
              person wants to take out a policy with the intent to make a profit.</p>
            <p align="justify">Physical Hazards are physical conditions that increase the possibility of a loss. They indicate the
              dangers of the subject of insurance which can be identified by inspection of the risk. Physical
              hazards indicate those dangers of the subject matter of insurance which can be ascertained or
              identified by mere inspection of the risk. The hazards are apparent in the subject- matter itself.
              The dangers are visible from the very nature, construction and situation of the subject-matter. For
              example, in motor insurance, the age, make, condition previous accidents, are all examples of
              physical hazard; in burglary insurance, the construction of the house, condition of doors and
              windows, existence or otherwise of burglar alarms, nature of contents, reputation or otherwise of
              the area are all examples of physical hazard; in personal accident insurance, physical hazard
              relates to age, occupation, health, physical condition and so on, of the proposer.</p>
            <p align="justify">Risk, peril, and hazard are terms used to indicate the possibility of loss, and are often used
              interchangeably, but the insurance industry distinguishes these terms. A risk is simply the
              possibility of a loss, but a peril is a cause of loss. A hazard is a condition that increases the
              possibility of loss. For instance, fire is a peril because it causes losses, while a fireplace is a
              hazard because it increases the probability of loss from fire. Some things can be both a peril and a
              hazard. Smoking, for instance, causes cancer and other health ailments, while also increasing the
              probability of such ailments.</p>

              <p><strong> KEY POINTS </strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management,
                  primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.</li>
                <li>There are two basic types of insurance – Life insurance and General Insurance. Life
                  Insurance pays the insured/policy holder or your beneficiaries a certain sum of money in
                  case of your death. General insurance is your protection from damages or losses excluded
                  from the life insurance.</li>
                <li>A proposer is a person or a firm who proposes for insurance cover to the insurance
                  company. Once a proposal along with the premium is accepted by the insurance company a

                  authorized representative pending issue of policy document to the insured in non-life

                <li>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or
                  compensation for a covered loss or policy event. In the event of claim under the policy,
                  immediate intimation in writing by a letter is required to be given by insured to office of
                  insurance company informing the policy number, name of insured, vehicle registration

                  cause of loss/damage.</li>
                <li>In principle of utmost good faith, both parties involved in an insurance contract—the
                  insured (policy holder) and the insurer (the company)—should act in good faith towards
                  each other. The insurer and the insured must provide clear and concise information
                  regarding the terms and conditions of the contract.</li>
                <li>The principle of insurable interest states that the person getting insured must have insurable
                  interest in the object of insurance. A person has an insurable interest when the physical
                  existence of the insured object gives him some gain but its non-existence will give him a
                  loss.</li>
                <li>The principle of indemnity asserts that on the happening of a loss the insured shall be put
                  back into the same financial position as he used to occupy immediately before the loss. In
                  other words, the insured shall get neither more nor less than the actual amount of loss
                  sustained.</li>
                <li>Principle of Causa Proxima or Proximate (i.e. nearest) Cause, means when a loss is caused
                  by more than one causes, the proximate or the nearest or the closest cause should be taken
                  into consideration to decide the liability of the insurer.</li>
                <li>Principle of contribution states that the insured can claim the compensation only to the
                  extent of actual loss either from all insurers or from any one insurer.</li>
                <li>According to the principle of subrogation, when the insured is compensated for the losses
                  due to damage to his insured property, then the ownership right of such property shifts to
                  the insurer.</li>
                <li>The principle of loss minimisation states that the insured must always try his level best to
                  minimise the loss of his insured property, in case of uncertain events like a fire outbreak or
                  blast, and so on.</li>
                <li>Risk is the likelihood that an insured event will occur, requiring the insurer to pay a claim.
                  A risk that conforms to the norms and specifications of the insurance policy in such a way
                  that the criterion for insurance is fulfilled is called insurable risk. Uninsurable risk is a
                  condition that poses unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would
                  be against the law.</li>
                <li>Peril is a specific risk or cause of loss covered by an insurance policy. A peril is an event
                  or circumstance that causes or may potentially cause a loss.</li>
                <li>Insurance hazard means the condition or situations that are likely to increases the chances
                  of a loss arising from a peril. The probability of happening of the undesired event may
                  become more certain or prominent if the subject-matter of insurance presents some peculiar
                  characteristics facilitating the causation of the event.</li>
                <li>Moral hazards are concerned with the attitude and conduct of people. They indicate those
                  dangers which relate to character, integrity and mental attitude of the insured. Physical
                  hazards are physical conditions that increase the possibility of a loss. They indicate the
                  dangers of the subject of insurance which can be identified by inspection of the risk.</li>

            <h3 id="two21">Insurers or Insurance Companies</h3>

            <p align="justify">Insurance companies lead to economic development by mobilizing savings and investing them
              into productive activities. Indian insurance companies are able to mobilize long-term savings to
              support economic growth and also facilitate economic development by providing insurance cover
              to a large segment of our people as well as to business enterprise throughout India. Role of
              insurance companies in economic development of India</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Capital Formation and Insurance:</strong> The contribution of insurance companies in the process of
              capital formation appears at all these stages. Insurance services act as a tool to mobilize saving,
              function as financial intermediary and at times also indulge in direct investment. Also govt. has
              made regulations under which every insurer carrying on business of life insurance shall invest
              25% of funds in Govt. securities and not less than 15% in infrastructure and social sector.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Encouraging Financial Stability and Reducing Anxiety:</strong> Insurer promotes financial stability in
              economy by insuring the risks and losses of individuals, firm and organizations. Because of
              uninsured large losses, firm may not be able to compensate for it leading to its insolvency which
              may cause loss of employment, revenue to supplier & Govt., loss of products to customer, etc.
              Moreover, it relieves the tensions and anxiety of individuals by securing the loss of their lives and
              assets.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Insurance as Financial Intermediary:</strong>The insurance companies perform extremely useful
              function in economy as financial intermediaries. Insurers help in reducing transaction cost in
              economy by collecting funds from policyholders and investing the same in different projects
              scattered over different regions. It is a specialized and time consuming job. The policyholders, in
              case of loss, are not required to wait for a long period for the amount of claim. It improves their
              liquidity. Insurers are in the position of financing large projects, railways power projects, etc.
              These large projects create economies of scale, facilitate technological innovation and
              specialization and thus promote economic efficiency and productivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Obligation to Rural and Social Sector:</strong> In India, the insurance companies are required to fulfill
              their obligation towards rural and social sector. For this, Life insurers are required to have 5%,
              7%, 10%, 12%, and 15% of total policies in first five years respectively in rural sector. Likewise
              General Insurers are required to have 2% 3% and 5% thereafter of total gross premium income
              written in first five financial years respectively in rural sector.</p>
            <p><strong>Promotes Trade and Commerce:</strong>The increase in GDP is positively correlated to growth of
              trade and commerce in economy. Whether it is production of goods and services, domestic or
              international trade or venture capital projects, insurance dominates everywhere. Even banks
              demand insurance cover of assets while granting loans for purchase of assets. Thus insurance
              covers, promotes specialization and flexibility in the economic system that play contributory role
              in healthy and smooth growth of trade and commerce.</p>
            <p><strong>Reducing Burden on Government Exchequer:</strong>Insurance companies, particularly life insurers
              provide a variety of insurance products covering needs of children, women and aged etc under
              social security network and thereby reduce the burden on Govt. exchequer in providing these
              services. This Govt., saves expenditure on these items and amount can be utilized for more
              productive projects. To conclude, we can say that insurance companies play an important role in
              economic development of country.</p>
            <p><strong>Saving and Insurance:</strong>Insurance companies lead to economic development by mobilizing
              savings and investing them into productive activities. Indian insurance companies are able to
              mobilize long-term savings to support economic growth and also facilitate economic development
              by providing insurance cover to a large segment of our people as well as to business enterprise
              throughout India.</p>
            <p><strong>Insurers/Insurance Companies in India</strong></p>
            <p>The insurance industry of India consists of 57 insurance companies of which 24 are in life
              insurance business and 33 are non-life insurers. Among the life insurers, Life Insurance
              Corporation (LIC) is the sole public sector company. Apart from that, among the non-life insurers
              there are six public sector insurers. In addition to these, there is sole national re-insurer, namely,
              General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC Re). Other stakeholders in Indian Insurance market
              include agents (individual and corporate), brokers, surveyors and third party administrators
              servicing health insurance claims. Out of 33 non-life insurance companies, five private sector
              insurers are registered to underwrite policies exclusively in health, personal accident and travel
              insurance segments. They are Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Ltd, Apollo Munich
              Health Insurance Company Ltd, Max Bupa Health Insurance Company Ltd, Religare Health
              Insurance Company Ltd and Cigna TTK Health Insurance Company Ltd. There are two more
              specialized insurers belonging to public sector, namely, Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of
              India for Credit Insurance and Agriculture Insurance Company Ltd for crop insurance.</p>
            <p>Life insurance companies offer coverage to the life of the individuals, whereas the non-life
              insurance companies offer coverage with our day-to-day living like travel, health, our car and
              bikes, and home insurance. Not only this, but the non-life insurance companies provide coverage
              for our industrial equipment’s as well. Crop insurance for our farmers, gadget insurance for
              mobiles, pet insurance etc. are some more insurance products being made available by the general
              insurance companies in India. The life insurance companies have gained an investment prospectus
              in the recent times with an idea of providing insurance along with a growth of your savings. But,
              the general insurance companies remain reluctant to offer pure risk cover to the individuals.</p>
            <h3 id="two31">Insurance Intermediaries</h3>
            <p>An insurance intermediary acts either on behalf of the client or the insurance company. Insurance
              intermediaries have been defined in the IRDAI Act, 1999 and section2 (1) (f) of the act states:
              Insurance intermediaries serve as a bridge between consumers and insurance companies, and
              includes individual agents, corporate agents including banks and brokers, insurance marketing
              firm. Insurance intermediary also includes surveyors and third party administrators but these
              intermediaries are not involved in procurement of business. Surveyors assess losses on behalf of
              the insurance companies. Third party administrators provide services related to health insurance
              for insurance companies through the insurance sector has been privatized the insurers can deal
              with intermediaries only if they are holding valid license issued by the authority and the authority
              has laid down the norms for licensing of intermediaries</p>
            <p>Traditionally, insurance intermediaries have been categorized as either insurance agents or
              insurance brokers. The distinction between the two relates to the manner in which they function in
              the marketplace. The role of insurance intermediaries in the overall economy is, essentially, one
              of making insurance – and other risk management products – widely available, thereby increasing
              the positive effects of insurance generally – risk-taking, investment, provision of basic societal
              needs and economic growth. There are several factors that intermediaries bring to the insurance
              marketplace that help to increase the availability of insurance generally:</p>
            <p><strong>Dissemination of Information to Consumers:</strong> Intermediaries provide customers with the
              necessary information required to make educated purchases/ informed decisions. Intermediaries
              can explain what a consumer needs, and what the options are in terms of insurers, policies and
              prices. Faced with a knowledgeable client base that has multiple choices, insurers will offer
              policies that fit their customers’ needs at competitive prices.</p>
            <p><strong>Dissemination of Information to the Marketplace:</strong>Intermediaries gather and evaluate
              information regarding placements, premiums and claims experience. When such knowledge is
              combined with an intermediary’s understanding of the needs of its clients, the intermediary is
              well-positioned to encourage and assist in the development of new and innovative insurance
              products and to create markets where none have existed. In addition, dissemination of knowledge
              and expansion of markets within a country and internationally can help to attract more direct
              investment for the insurance sector and related industries.</p>
            <p><strong>Innovative Marketing:</strong>Insurance intermediaries bring innovative marketing practices to the
              insurance marketplace. This deepens and broadens insurance markets by increasing consumers’
              awareness of the protections offered by insurance, their awareness of the multitude of insurance
              options, and their understanding as to how to purchase the insurance they need.</p>
            <h3 id="two41">Insurance Brokers</h3>
            <p>An insurance broker is seen as one of the intermediaries who operate in the insurance market. In
              the Indian context, the insurance broker is a person who will represent the insured and add value
              to the transaction. An insurance broker is a professional who offers, negotiates, and sells policies.
              He acts as intermediary between insurers and customers and receives compensation. An
              important role of brokers is to help insurers to assess the types of risks they face. At the same
              time, brokers act on behalf of and in the interest of customers. They do comparison shopping to
              find the best deals and offer policies from more than one insurance company. Brokers also help
              their clients to outline risk management strategies, which are suitable for their profile. Insurance
              brokers consult clients and gather information for them. This is important as to understand their
              specific needs. Brokers help individuals and businesses to find the right accident, health, life,
              casualty, and property insurance. They offer a wide array of services such as claims assistance,
              consulting services, and resolving benefit issues. They also help clients to stay updated on
              legislative and regulatory changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong>
              The role and responsibilities of the insurance broker has multiplied in the sense that he not only
              has to get the right price for the insured to enable him to take informed decision to select the right
              underwriter, but he also has a duty towards the underwriter to ensure that all parameters of rating
              a risk have been rightly applied. This is only to ensure that a clear balance is maintained so that
              one does not impinge on the other in the event of a catastrophe. They negotiate with insurance
              companies to be able to offer the best terms and premiums to clients. In addition, they help clients
              to mitigate risks and come up with working risk management strategies. In addition to advising
              clients, brokers handle policy renewals and amend policies, if required. They maintain
              relationships with engineers, photographers, surveyors, financial institutions, and insurance
              companies. Thus they can act on behalf of clients and deal with administrative tasks such as
              correspondence with insurers and other professionals, paperwork, etc.</p>
            <p>The functions of a broker shall include any one or more of the following.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acting promptly on instructions from a client and providing him written acknowledgements and progress reports.</li>
              <li>Assisting clients in paying premium under section 64VB of Insurance Act, 1938 (4 of 1938).</li>
              <li>Assisting in the negotiation of the claims and familiarizing himself with the client's business and underwriting information so that this can be explained to an insurer and others.</li>
              <li>Maintaining detailed knowledge of available insurance markets, as may be applicable.</li>
              <li>Maintaining proper records of claims.</li>
              <li>Obtaining detailed information of the client's business and risk management philosophy.</li>
              <li>Providing requisite underwriting information as required by an insurer in assessing the risk to decide pricing terms and conditions for cover.</li>
              <li>Providing services related to insurance consultancy and risk management.</li>
              <li>Rendering advice on appropriate insurance cover and terms.</li>
              <li>Submitting quotation received from insurer/s for consideration of a client.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Degrees and certificates requirements for brokers would depend on the country or state ofresidence. Without a degree, brokers usually hold an administrative or support position until theygain experience. Successful brokers have good interpersonal, communication, and written skills.
              They negotiate with and consult insurers and customers and should be able to develop andmaintain relationships with different professionals. They also have business acumen, IT andadministrative skills, as well as customer service skills. Brokers read specialist journals and press to stay updated and attend seminars. Brokerages usually offer training in legal and insuranceissues, and there are other training schemes. Individuals who seek to become insurance brokers should have a clean background. Misdemeanors and offences reduce one’s chances of becoming one.</p>
            <p><strong>Categories of Insurance Brokers</strong></p>
            <p>IRDA has permitted 3 types of Brokers to operate in India:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Direct Broker (between end-users and primary insurers only) </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Direct (Life Insurance)</li>
            <li>Direct (General Insurance)</li>
            <li>Direct (Life and General Insurance)</li>
            <li>Re-insurance Brokers (between primary insurers and re-insurers only) and</li>
            <li> Composite Brokers (both the above).</li>
            <p><strong>Direct Broker</strong>Direct broker means an insurance broker who for the time-being licensed by the Authority to act
              as such, for a remuneration carries out the functions as specified under regulation 3 either in the
              field of life insurance or general insurance or both on behalf of his clients. Life insurance brokers
              are instrumental in assessing needs and establishing the type of life insurance most suitable to
              address those needs. Life insurance brokers search the market on your behalf, helping secure the
              most suitable cover, at the most affordable price possible. General Insurance brokers sell non-life
              insurances. There are two types of general insurance brokers who specialises in different covers
              and policies. Retail general insurance brokers are professionals who act on behalf of companies
              and individuals. They offer policies such as health, travel, home, and car insurance, along with
              private and public liability and employer’s liability plans. Commercial general insurance brokers
              specialise in areas such as gas, oil, marine, and aviation and offer complex and high value
              policies. Commercial insurance policies cover equipment, machinery, and real estate in the event
              of theft or damage.</p>

            <p><strong>Reinsurance Broker</strong></p>
            <p>A reinsurance broker is a person who acts as an intermediary between an insurance company and
              a reinsurance company. Reinsurance brokers work for the insurance company and their job is to
              acquire reinsurance for it. This can involve negotiating rates and finding the best policies. Many
              insurance companies use reinsurance brokers because the process of purchasing reinsurance can
              be complicated. They rely on reinsurance brokers' specialized skills to help them get the best
              deals possible. After all, reinsurance policies will only really help insurance companies if they
              provide adequate coverage at reasonable rates. Otherwise, the companies could be paying too
              much for too little protection.</p>

            <p>Composite broker means an insurance broker who for the time-being registered by the Authority to act as such, for a remuneration or fee,arranges insurance for its clients with insurers and/orreinsurance for its client/s with insurers and reinsurers located in India and abroad. A composite
              broker shall carry out any one or more of the functions mentioned for a direct brokers and reinsurance broker</p>
            <h3 id="two51"><strong>Insurance Agents</strong></h3>
            <p>An insurance agent’s role is primarily that of a communicator, counselor and facilitator. The
              prospective customer can buy the best insurance products and services for his/her varied
              requirements viz. life, property, health, burglary insurance from the insurance agent. An agent is a
              primary source for procurement of insurance business and as such his role is the corner stone for
              building a solid edifice of any life insurance organization. An agent must be equipped with
              technical aspects of insurance knowledge, he must possess analytical ability to analyze customers’
              need, he must be abreast with up to date knowledge of merits or demerits of other instruments of
              investment available in the financial market, he must be endowed with a burning desire of social
              service and over and above all this, he must possess and develop an undeterred determination to
              succeed as an insurance salesman. In short he must be an agent with professional approach in
              insurance salesmanship. Such an agency force is expected to be helpful not only in proper field
              underwriting but also after sales servicing, concomitant and essential elements for higher
              retention of business.</p>
            <p>Agents and brokers act as intermediaries between the insurance buyer and the insurers. Each has a
              legal duty to help you obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable price. Each must have a license
              to distribute the type of insurance he or she is selling. An agent or broker must also adhere to the
              regulations enforced by your state insurance department. The main difference between a broker
              and an agent has to do with whom they represent. An agent represents one or more insurance
              companies. He or she acts as an extension of the insurer. A broker, on the other hand, represents
              the insurance buyer.</p>
            <h3 id="two61">Point of Sales Person(s) (POS) Persons</h3>
            <p>IRDAI has also permitted distribution of life insurance through corporate agents and brokers.
              Some of the NBFCs, who have a network of branches and customer base became corporate agents
              and offered life insurance products along with their core products. Brokers are specialist entities,
              who represent the interest of the customers and can work with multiple life insurers. Despite of all
              these channels of distribution, the insurance penetration of India continues to be low; indicating a
              large section of the population is still uninsured or underinsured. IRDAI, regulator for the
              industry has been proactive and continuously engages with the industry in development of
              distribution of life insurance products, while ensuring the protection of consumer interest. One
              such new initiative of IRDAI is the Point of Sale (POS) person for distributing insurance
              products. IRDAI has allowed POS person to sell basic insurance products to increase insurance
              penetration in the country. This is a newer channel for distributing of insurance products and
              IRDAI has issued guidelines for POS’P and also on products that can be offered through this POS
              channel.</p>
            <p>The POS person can sell only simple and easy to understand products wherein each and every
              benefit under the product is predefined and disclosed upfront clearly to the customer. POS can
              solicit and market only certain pre-underwritten products approved by the authority. The POS can
              sell comprehensive motor insurance, third-party liability, personal accident cover, travel insurance
              policy, home insurance policy and any other policy specifically approved by Irdai. Every policy
              sold through POS will be separately identified and pre-fixed by the name POS. The insurer will
              have to file the product with the regulator under the file-use guidelines for information. POS
              model will help the insurers to increase the breadth and depth of their distribution capability and it
              is expected that POS will make significant contribution in distributing insurance in the coming
              years. As far as the customers are concerned, POS will make insurance available at a place closer
              to them and also help in better servicing capability. Since the products offered through POS are
              easy to understand with clearly defined benefits, the scope for mis-sale has been substantially
              minimized.</p>
            <p>Any individual aged above 18 years with 10th standard pass qualification can become a POS
              person and has to undergo a simplified training and pass the examination. Every POS will be
              identified by the Aadhaar Card Number or his PAN Card. IRDA has dispensed mandatory
              training and certification for point of sales person. Earlier, it was mandatory to take training and
              certificate from the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology. The persons
              soliciting and marketing such pre-underwritten products approved by the authority as POS will
              have to be at least a matriculate. The POS will be made liable to a penalty as per the provisions of
              Section 102 of the Act. Wherever sales are done through the insurance intermediary, the latter
              will record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN of the POS in the proposal form. Also, the POS
              when engaged by the insurer, POS will place business with that insurer subject to compliance of
              rules and procedures of that insurance company</p>

            <h1>Module-3</h1>
            <h2 id="three122">PRINICPLES AND PRACTISE OF INSURANCE</h2>
            <p>Insurance may be defined as a contract between two parties whereby one party called insurer undertakes in exchange for a fixed sum called premium to pay the other party called insured a fixed amount of money after happening of a certain event. Insurance policy is a legal contract and its formation is subject to the fulfillment of the requisites of a contract defined under Indian Contract Act 1872. According to the Act “A Contract may be defined as an agreement between two or more parties to do or to abstain from doing an act, with an intention to create a legally binding relationship. Since Insurance is a contract, certain sections of Indian Contract Act are applicable. Insurance, like every other contract, is formed when there is an offer made, that offer is accepted, and consideration (payment or a promise to pay premium) is given.</p>
            <p>The insurance contract involves—(A) the elements of the general contract, and (B) the element of special contract relating to insurance.</p>
            <p>The special contract of insurance involves principles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Insurable Interest.</li>
              <li>Utmost Good Faith.</li>
              <li>Indemnity.</li>
              <li>Subrogation.</li>
              <li>Warranties.</li>
              <li>Proximate Cause.</li>
              <li>Assignment and Nomination.</li>
              <li>Return of Premium</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The valid contract, according to Section 10 of Indian Contract Act 1872, must have the following essentialities</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Agreement (offer and acceptance),</li>
              <li>Legal consideration,</li>
              <li>Competent to make a contract,</li>
              <li>Free consent,</li>
              <li>Legal object.</li>
              <li>Writing and Registration</li>
              <li>Possibility of Performance</li>
              <li>Certainty and</li>
              <li>Agreement not declared void</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three112">Offer (Proposal) and Acceptance</h3>
            <P>The offer for entering into the contract may come from the insured. The insurer may also propose to make the contract. Whether the offer is from the side of an insurer or from the side of insured, the main fact is acceptance. Any act that precedes it is the offer or a counter-offer. All that preceded the offerer counter-offer is an invitation to offer. In insurance, the publication of the prospectus, the canvassing of the agents are invitations to offer. Generally, the acceptance of the offer must be communicated to the offerer, unless the offerer waives this requirement. It may be possible to infer acceptance from conduct, such as where the insured pays, or the insurers accept, the premium. If the offer is made by the insurer, the communication of an acceptance to a third party, such as a broker, is insufficient unless the broker is the agent of the insurer, which is not usually the case.</P>
            <P>The acceptance must match the offer and be unconditional, otherwise it may be regarded as a counter offer, which will be a rejection of the original offer and will begin the whole process over again. When the prospect (the potential policy-holder) proposes to enter the contract, it is an offer and if there is any alteration in the offer that would be a counter-offer. If this alteration or change (counter-offer) ill-accepted by the proposer, it would be acceptable. In the absence of counter-offer, the acceptance of the offer will be an acceptance by the insurer. At the moment, the notice of acceptance is given to another party; it would be a valid acceptance. For example, where in response to a proposal by the prospective insured the insurer sends out a policy that includes a term of which the prospective insured was previously unaware, this might constitute a counter-offer. On the other hand, where the insurer responds with a policy in standard form, then as long as it is not inconsistent with the proposal, it may be held to be a valid acceptance even though it includes terms not expressly communicated, if the insured could reasonably be expected to know that there would be such terms.</P>
            <P>It is a general principle of contract law that once an offer has been accepted and an agreement formed neither party may unilaterally withdraw. The contract may, of course, give the parties the right to cancel the contract. Where a policy contains a term allowing cancellation by the insurer, it will usually also provide for a portion of the premium to be repaid to the insured. It is common for an agreement on insurance to specify that either the contract is not binding or, alternatively, that the contract is binding but the risk does not commence, until a specified requirement is met, such as the payment of the premium or the completion of a satisfactory medical examination</P>
            <P>For example, in life insurance an offer can be made either by the insurance company or the applicant (proposer) and the acceptance will follow.</P><P>For instance,</P>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>An offer made by the Insurance company to proposer that the premium amount will be INR.500/- per annum for the Insurance amount of INR.5000/-. It is for the proposer toaccept the offer or not</li>
              <li>An advertisement in the newspaper about the availability of different life Insurance policies is an invitation for an offer. If a proposer makes an application, then it will be offer from the applicant and the insurance company may or may not accept it.</li>
              <li>An offer may be considered accepted either when the insurance company issues the policy or the first premium is paid by the applicant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As stated above in example (a) if the applicant pays the first premium of INR 500/- to the insurance company then the contract is completed as both the parties have accepted the offer. Similarly, if the company issues the policy in above stated example (b) then the offer is accepted by the insurance company and the contract is completed.</p>
            <p>The offer or proposal and its acceptance may be verbal or in writing but in insurance contracts these are in writing. In general insurance the insured offers to purchase an insurance from the insurer and this offer is in the form of a proposal form and the insurer after studying the proposal can either reject the proposal or accept it. In case he accepts he issues a cover note or a letter of acceptance. In the latter event the acceptance letter becomes a counter offer or proposal, which is accepted on payment of premium by the insured.</p>
            <h3 id="three212">Consideration (Premium)</h3>
            <p>A consideration is an exchange of money for the guarantee of an act preformed or another benefit provided. For a contract to be binding each party to the contract must give what is known as consideration or the exchange of values on which a contract is based. In an insurance contract, the insured person makes a premium payment (consideration now) and promises to comply with the provisions of the policy (consideration future). In return, the insurance company promises to pay in accordance with the terms of the contract. The premium will be set by the insurers at a level that attracts business, but that also both reflects the risk of a claim by this insured and, across the business as a whole, is likely to result in a profit. The premium will be payable either in a single sum or, more typically in consumer cases, by installments on credit terms. Even where the premium is payable by installments, it is still a single premium for the entire period, so that if the risk is terminated the outstanding installments will still have to be paid on the principle that the risk is not divisible unless the parties have agreed to the contrary. The premium is an important aspect of the agreement, and if one has not been agreed by the parties this may indicate that they have not concluded a contract</p>
            <h3 id="three31">Competent to make a Contract</h3>
            <p>Another essential element for a contract is that the parties to the contract must be competent parties, or of undiminished mental capacity. Most people are competent to contract, but there are exceptions. A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. A person who is usually of unsound mind, but, occasionally of sound mind may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A contract made by incompetent party/parties will be void. If a contract is made with a minor the application may be held unenforceable if the minor decides to repudiate it at a later date. In insurance contract the insurer is bound by the contract as long as the underage wishes to continue it. If the minor repudiates his contract, the law will allow him a refund of all premium paid. Insanity or mental incompetence precludes the making of a valid insurance contract.</p>
            <h3 id="three41">Free Consent</h3>
            <p>Parties entering into the contract should enter into it by their free consent. The consent will be free when it is not caused by, coercion, mistake, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Both parties to the contract should be of the same mind and there must be consent arising out of common intention. Both parties should be clear about what the other is saying. The Insurer should know what the insured wants, and the insured should know what the insurer is offering, and both should be agreed on this. The proposal for free consent must sign a declaration to this effect, the person explaining the subject matter of the proposal to the proposer must also accordingly make a written declaration or the proposal. When there is no free consent except fraud, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. In case of fraud, the contract would be void.</p>
            <p>Factors which invalidate free consent</p>
            <p><Strong>Coercion: </Strong>Coercion’ is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.</p>
            <p><Strong>Undue Influence: </Strong>When the parties to the contract are in relationships in such a way that one party can dominate the will of the other and uses the unfair advantage so gained to obtain the consent of the other party, then the consent is said to have been obtained by undue influence.  Now, the Contract Act 1872 also provides instances where a person can dominate the will of another</p>
            <p><strong>Fraud: </strong>Consent is not said to be free when it has been obtained by means of fraud. In such cases, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by means of fraud. Moreover, fraud is also a tort where action for damages can lie. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 gives the definition of the term ‘Fraud’.  The law provides five acts which when committed either by the party or with his assistance or by his agent, with the intention to deceive the other party, amounts to fraud.</p>
            <p><strong>Misrepresentation: </strong>Misrepresentation under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 has an exhaustive definition and can be divided into 3 types.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first type is when a statement is made by a person, about a fact which is not true, though he believes it to be true. </li>
              <li>Second is the type when there is a breach of duty by a person who is making the false statement and he gains some kind of advantage even though it wasn’t his intention to deceive the other party. </li>
              <li>The third is the type where if one party acting innocently, causes the other party to make any mistake with regards to the subject matter of the agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Mistake: </strong>When one of the parties has given its consent to the contract under some kind of misunderstanding then the consent is said to be have been given by mistake. If it wasn’t for the misunderstanding the party would not have entered into the agreement.</p>
            <h3 id="three51">Legal Purpose</h3>
            <p>A contract must have a legal purpose-that is, it must not be for the performance of an activity prohibited by law, immoral, opposed to public policy, and which defeat the provisions of any law. If it does not, enforcing the contract would be contrary to public policy. In the proposal from the object of insurance is asked which should be legal and the object should not be concealed. If the object of insurance, like the consideration, is found to be unlawful, the policy is void.
              Contracts may be either oral or written; they must, however, follow a specific legal form, or appropriate language.</p>
            <h3 id="three61">Principles of Insurance </h3>
            <p>The main objective of every insurance contract is to give financial security and protection to the insured from any future uncertainties. The principles of insurance are the rule of action or conduct adopted by the participants involved in the insurance business. The specific principles of a valid insurance contract consist of the following.</p>
            <p><strong>Utmost Good Faith   (Uberrimae Fidei)</strong></p>
            <p>Under this principle, both parties involved in an insurance contract—the insured (policy holder) and the insurer (the company)—should act in good faith towards each other. The insurer and the insured must provide clear and concise information regarding the terms and conditions of the contract. This is a very basic and primary principle of insurance contracts because the nature of the service is for the insurance company to provide a certain level of security and solidarity to the insured person’s life. However, the insurance company must also watch out for anyone looking for a way to scam them into free money. So each party is expected to act in good faith towards each other. If the insurance company provides the insured/policy holder with falsified or misrepresented information, then they are liable in situations where this misrepresentation or falsification has caused the insured/policyholder loss. If the insured/policy holder have misrepresented information regarding subject matter or your own personal history, then the insurance company’s liability becomes void (revoked).</p>
            <p><strong>Insurable Interest</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of insurable interest states that the person getting insured must have insurable interest in the object of insurance. A person has an insurable interest when the physical existence of the insured object gives him some gain, but its non-existence will give him a loss. In simple words, the insured person must suffer some financial loss by the damage of the insured object. It means that the subject matter of the contract must provide some financial gain by existing for the insured (or policyholder) and would lead to a financial loss if damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. The owner of the subject is said to have an insurable interest until he/she is no longer the owner.</p>
            <p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of indemnity asserts that on the happening of a loss the insured shall be put back into the same financial position as he used to occupy immediately before the loss. In other words, the insured shall get neither more nor less than the actual amount of loss sustained. This, of course, is always subject to the limit of the sum insured and also subject to certain terms and conditions of the policy. In general insurance contracts principle of indemnity is applicable which says that insured would be compensated only the actual loss suffered by him at the time of accident and not more. Hence to arrive at the actual loss firstly the market value of the property on the date of accident is ascertained and then the sum insured or market value whichever is less is paid subject to policy conditions and completion of the formalities required for settlement of claim. Life insurance and personal accident insurance policies are the exception where the principle of indemnity does not apply and sum insured as mentioned in the policy is paid at the time of an admissible claim. For example, A house is insured against fire for Rs. 50000. It is burnt down and found that the expenditure of Rs. 30000 will restore it to its original condition. The insurer is liable to pay only Rs. 30000. In life insurance, principle of indemnity does not apply as there is no question of actual loss. The insurer is required to pay a fixed amount upon in advance in the event of accident, death or at the expiry of the fixed term of the policy. Thus, a contract of a life insurance is a contingent contract and not a contract of indemnity.</p>
            <p><strong>Proximate Cause (Causa Proxima)</strong></p>
            <p>Principle of Causa Proxima or Proximate (i.e. nearest) Cause, means when a loss is caused by more than one causes, the proximate or the nearest or the closest cause should be taken into consideration to decide the liability of the insurer. The principle states that to find out whether the insurer is liable for the loss or not, the proximate and not the remote must be looked into. That is the loss of insured property can be caused by more than one incident even in succession to each other.  Property may be insured against some but not all causes of loss, and when a property is not insured against all causes, the nearest cause is to be found out.  If the proximate cause is one in which the property is insured against, then the insurer must pay compensation. If it is not a cause the property is insured against, then the insurer does not have to pay. For example In a marine insurance policy, the goods were insured against damage by sea water, some rats on the board made a hole in a bottom of the ship causing sea water to pour into the ship and damage the goods. Here, the proximate cause of loss is sea water which is covered by the policy and the hole made by the rats is a remote cause. Therefore, the insured can recover damage from the insurer</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution </strong></p>
            <p>Principle of contribution is a corollary of the principle of indemnity. It applies to all contracts of indemnity, if the insured has taken out more than one policy on the same subject matter. According to this principle, the insured can claim the compensation only to the extent of actual loss either from all insurers or from any one insurer. If one insurer pays full compensation then that insurer can claim proportionate claim from the other insurers. As per this principle applicable to the general insurance policies, if the insured has more than one policy for the same property of the same value and if the loss is suffered due to damage to such property then the loss is shared and contributed between all the insurers in equal proportions or as per the proportion of the sum insured or as mentioned in the policy. The principle of contribution further strengthens the principle of indemnity applicable in general insurance contracts. This principle is not applicable in life and personal accident insurance. For example, A gets his property insured against fire for Rs. 10000 with insurer P and for Rs. 20000 with insurer Q. a loss of Rs. 15000 occurs, P is liable to pay for Rs. 5000 and Q is labile to pay Rs 10000. If the whole amount of loss is paid by Q, then Q can recover Rs. 5000 from P. The liability of P and Q will be determined as under:</p>
            <p>Sum insured with Individual insurer (i.e. P or Q) x Actual Loss  = Total sum insured</p>
            <p>Liability of P = 10000   x 15000              = Rs.5000/30000</p>
            <p>Liability of Q = 20000   x 15000        		 = Rs.10000/30000</p>
            <p>The right of contribution arises when</p>
            <ol type ="i">
              <li> There are different policies which related to the same subject matters;</li>
              <li> The policies cover the same period which caused the loss;</li>
              <li> All the policies are in force at the time of loss; and</li>
              <li> One of the insurer has paid to the insured more than his share of loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Subrogation </strong></p>
            <p>Principle of subrogation is an extension and another corollary of the principle of indemnity. It also applies to all contracts of indemnity.  According to the principle of subrogation, when the insured is compensated for the losses due to damage to his insured property, then the ownership right of such property shifts to the insurer. This principle is applicable only when the damaged property has any value after the event causing the damage. The insurer can benefit out of subrogation rights only to the extent of the amount he has paid to the insured as compensation. For example in marine cargo policies, in the transit by railways, after having paid the claim for the loss suffered by the insured due to damage or loss of insured goods, due to the subrogation rights the insurer become entitled to receive the claim amount from the railway authorities. The application of principle of subrogation is required to follow the rule of indemnity in general insurance contracts only and not in life or personal accident insurance policies. For example: Furniture is insured for Rs. 1 LAC against fire, it is burnt down and the insurer pays the full value of Rs. 1 LAC to the insured, later on the damage Furniture is sold for Rs. 10,000. The insurer is entitled to receive the sum of Rs. 10,000.</p>
            <p><strong>Loss of Minimisation </strong></p>
            <p>According to the principle of loss minimisation, insured must always try his level best to minimize the loss of his insured property, in case of uncertain events like a fire outbreak or blast, and so on. The insured must take all possible measures and necessary steps to control and reduce the losses in such a scenario. The insured must not neglect and behave irresponsibly during such events just because the property is insured. It is the main responsibility of the insured to act diligently and take all steps to cut losses to the insured property. For example, If a house is insured against fire, and there is accidental fire, the owner must take all reasonable steps to keep the loss minimum. He is supposed to take all steps which a man of ordinary prudence will take under the circumstances to save the insured property.</p>
            <h3 id="three71">Proposal Form</h3>
            <p>Proposal form is the most important and basic document required for an insurance contract between the insured and insurance company. It includes the insured's fundamental information such as address, age, name, education, occupation and so on. It also includes the person's medical history.  An insurance company offers a policy on the basis of a proposal form. The form is the most basic requirement for the functioning of the insurance contract between the insured and the insurance company. It needs to be completed by the proposer who may seek the assistance of a life insurance advisor to fill it up.When purchasing insurance, it is necessary for the prospect to provide the insurer with information so that it can assess the risk. When purchasing insurance, it is necessary for the prospect to provide the insurer with information so that it can assess the risk. This is usually done by filling in a proposal form, often available from agents, brokers, or insurers. Proposal forms are questionnaires issued by the insurer to be completed by the proposer or his/her agent, which ask questions about the subject matter of cover. A proposal form seeks basic information of the proposer and the assured. The proposer has to mention his/her income in the proposal form to satisfy the insurer about his/her ability to pay for the insurance and the need for insurance, respectively. Proposal form helps the insurance company to calculate all the potential risks in relation to the insurance policy and hence deciding the premium amount. Since the insurer will use the information to assess a premium and set the terms and conditions of the policy, the prospective insured must disclose all the material circumstances, whether or not the proposal form asks for them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proposal forms elicit information. They provide underwriters with the information they need to decide whether or not to accept the proposal and, if so, at what price and on what terms. Standardized forms are easier for the applicant and make underwriting more efficient and consistent.</li>
              <li>A proposal form often constitutes a legal offer by the proposer, although offers can also be made orally.</li>
              <li>Sometimes a proposal form is filled in as a request to the insurers for a quotation on price and terms. The insurer’s quotation is then the legal offer.</li>
              <li>Many proposal forms or prospectuses summarize the cover obtainable under the insurance contract.</li>
              <li>Proposal forms may also advertise other products available from the insurer.</li>
              <li>In some cases, the wording and declaration in a proposal form often warrants the truth of the answers thereon. It is to be noted, however, that this practice has now been ameliorated in view of consumer protection.</li>
              <p>On the structure of a proposal form, a typical one has four main sections. The first asks the proposer general questions relating to his/her personal details, insurance history, and details of the subject matter.</p>

            <h3 id="three91">Payment of Premium </h3>
            <p>Premium paying term is the total number of years for the policy holder to pay the premium.
              Policy term is normally equal to the premium paying term. However, some insurance policies give the insured the autonomy to choose a premium paying term lower than the policy term. For instance, insurers allow the insured to get the insurance benefits even if they stop the premium payments after a stipulated period of time by converting the normal insurance policy into a paid up policy. One of the important factors to consider while buying aninsurance plan is the premium paying mode. Therefore, while opting to buy an insurance plan, one should be aware that these insurance policies come with different premium payment options. The insured should make the selection as per their requirement taking the help of an adviser. The mode of payment is the frequency in which a policy owner elects to pay premiums. Frequency options are typically annual, semi-annual, quarterly and monthly on auto insurance policies. The monthly option may be slightly higher than semi-annual premiums because additional expenses are incurred.
            </p>
            <p>The premium to be paid by any person proposing to take an insurance policy or by the policyholder to an insurer may be made in any one or more of the following manner(s), namely:-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cash</li>
              <li>Any recognized banking negotiable instrument such as cheques, including demand drafts, pay orders, banker’s cheques drawn on any scheduled bank in India</li>
              <li>Postal money orders</li>
              <li>Credit or Debit Cards held in his name</li>
              <li>Bank Guarantee or Cash Deposit</li>
              <li>Internet</li>
              <li>E-transfer</li>
              <li>Direct credits via standing instructions of proposer or the policyholder or the life insured through bank transfers and </li>
              <li>Any other method of payment as may be approved by the Authority from time to time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Regular premium payment is the most recommended mode and it involves paying premium monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. The regular premium mode is advised firstly because of the affordability factor. An annual payment would require the insured to pay his/her premium once a year. This would be the most affordable option for him/her, since the insurance company would not spend as much time and money processing payments.  If the insured chose a semi-annual payment, then he/she would pay her premium every six months (twice a year). His/her premium payments would be a bit higher than if he/she chose an annual payment frequency, but it might be easier for him/her to budget for two smaller payments instead of one larger one.  A quarterly payment would require the insured to make a payment every three months (four payments a year). The insured would find it easier to budget for four smaller payments, but his/her policy premium would be higher.  A monthly payment would require the insured to pay a premium every month (twelve times a year), and it would likely have the highest policy premium, since the insurance company would need to process these twelve payments per year</p>
            <p><strong>Online Premium Payment</strong></p>
            <p>Premium can be paid by proposer or policy holder either by cash, cheque, bank draft, bank pay order, credit/debit card, Internet or e-transfer or direct credit through bank transfer or through bank guarantee or cash deposit. As an existing policyholder he/she can now make their renewal premium payment online. It is easy, convenient and takes very little time. All they have to do is click on the link given in the website, provide their policy number and date of birth for verification and pay their premium through a secure online gateway. Premium payment can be done any online payment mode such as NEFT, Net banking, mobile banking, internet banking and other modes.</p>
            <p>An insurance premium is generally expressed as premium per thousand rupees of sum assured and is illustrated in the form of tables of premium rates by insurance companies. Premium varies across insurance plans, policy terms, sum assured and the age of the proposer. Periodicity or mode of premium payment depends on the type of policy chosen and also on the payment options that the policy offers </p>
            <p><strong>In Advance</strong></p>
            <p>Premium is required to be paid in advance and can be paid via cash up to Rs 50,000, (the limit set by IRDA for cash payments) cheque or DD. Further, most insurance companies have provided for payment of premium online.</p>
            <p><strong>Discounts Offered on Insurance Premiums</strong></p>
            <p>Often companies offer a discount on the premium rate payable on the basis of sum assured and the mode of payment of premium. </p>
            <p><strong>Rebate for Sum Assured </strong></p>
            <p>Typically most companies offer rebates for higher sum assured (higher than a certain amount). This is because the cost of servicing of all policies of the same type being almost the same, a higher sum assured means lower servicing cost per unit of sum assured. Consequently, this translates to higher profits/returns per unit of sum assured or per unit of premium paid for the company.</p>
            <p><strong>Rebate for Periodicity of Premium </strong></p>
            <p>In case of periodic premium payment policies one can normally choose to pay premium annually, half yearly, quarterly or monthly depending on one’s cash flow situation. However, higher the frequency of premium payment higher the cost of servicing (collection, processing and administrative costs) for the company. Also, if the premium is paid at one go for the whole year the funds are available (for investment) to the company for longer than in monthly mode of payment. Consequently, the company can earn more returns on the premium paid. In case of single or limited premium payment policies this rebate is often already worked into the premium rate as the mode of payment is structurally built into the policy. </p>
            <p><strong>Extra Premium</strong></p>
            <p>The normal premium tables are meant for people who do not carry any additional risk or ‘standard lives’ in insurance parlance. In case of standard lives the ordinary premium rates are applied. However, in case of people who carry extra risk because they suffer from health problems such as diabetes or heart disease or work in hazardous occupation the insurer may charge extra premium over and above the normal rate. Extra premium is also charged for any additional insurance covers (called ‘Add-ons’ or ‘riders’ in insurance jargon) are bought along with the base policy. </p>
            <p><strong>Level Premium</strong></p>
            <p>When the premium charged under a policy remains the same throughout the duration of the contract, it is called level premium. In this case premium level is guaranteed and cannot be changed by the company at a later date. This is advantageous for both the assured and the insurance company and therefore most insurance plans except some insurance plans involve level premium payment.</p>
            <p><strong>Single Premium</strong></p>
            <p>Single premium policies are normally targeted at people who are in the higher income bracket or those who have idle money with them. Single-premium policy charges the policyholder a single up-front premium payment to fully fund the policy. It was once a popular tax shelter.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Payment and Late Payment of Premium</strong></p>
            <p>In case the premium is not paid on the due date, the policy is considered as lapsed and the policyholder loses its benefits. Most policy contracts, however, provide for a 'grace period', which gives the policy holder an additional period of time after the due date for the payment of the premium. During this period, he/she can pay the premium without any extra charge and the policy will still continue to be in force.  For all  insurance policies other than term insurance, for monthly mode of payment, the grace period is usually 15 days, while for other frequency of payments (quarterly, half-yearly or yearly) it is usually one month but not less than 30 days (This means that in case of February generally 30 days grace is still given). For term insurance policies, the grace period is normally 15 days. When a policy has lapsed, it can be revived and brought to its full force by payment of overdue premiums (with interest) and a declaration about state of health or fresh medical examination. However, a lapsed policy can be revived only if the insurer agrees to do so.</p>
            <p><strong>Tax Benefit Available for Premium Paid </strong></p>
            <p>Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, any amount paid by a policyholder towards insurance premium for self, spouse or his/her children can be claimed as deduction from taxable income. Premium paid for policies in the name of any other third party (other than spouse or children) such as parents (father/mother/both) or in-laws is not eligible for deduction under section 80C If a person is paying premium for more than one insurance policy, all the premiums can be included. The benefit is available for insurance policies sold by all insurance companies – both public and private sector. </p>
            <h3 id="three101">Section 64 VB of Insurance Act</h3>
            <p>In all cases of risks covered by the policies issued by an insurer, the attachment of risk to an insurer will be in consonance with the terms of Section 64VB of the Act and except in the cases where the premium has been paid in cash, in all other cases the insurer shall be on risk only after the receipt of the premium by the insurer.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, No risk to be assumed unless premium is received in advance.—</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>No insurer shall assume any risk in India in respect of any insurance business on which premium is not ordinarily payable outside India unless and until the premium payable is received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such person in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as may be prescribed, is made in advance in the prescribed manner.</li>
              <li>For the purposes of this section, in the case of risks for which premium can be ascertained in advance, the risk may be assumed not earlier than the date on which the premium has been paid in cash or by cheque to the insurer. Explanation.—Where the premium is tendered by postal money order or cheque sent by post, the risk may be assumed on the date on which the money order is booked or the cheque is posted, as the case may be.</li>
              <li>Any refund of premium which may become due to an insured on account of the cancellation of a policy or alteration in its terms and conditions or otherwise shall be paid by the insurer directly to the insured by a crossed or order cheque or by postal money order and a proper receipt shall be obtained by the insurer from the insured, and such refund shall in no case be credited to the account of the agent.</li>
              <li>Where an insurance agent collects a premium on a policy of insurance on behalf of an insurer, he shall deposit with, or dispatch by post to, the insurer, the premium so collected in full without deduction of his commission within twenty-four hours of the collection excluding bank and postal holidays.</li>
              <li>The Central Government may, by rules, relax the requirements of sub-section (1) in respect of particular categories in insurance policies.</li>
              <li>The Authority may, from time to time, specify, by the regulations made by it, the manner of receipt of premium by the insurer.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="three111">Premium Receipt</h3>
            <p>Premium receipt is a receipt issued to the policyholder by the insurer or the insurer's agent which proves that payment has been received. Insurance policy receipt issued upon payment of the first premium by an applicant. It makes the policy in force before the policy documents are issued, provided the applicant meets all requirements. The insurer provides the proposal form and other related documents and the underwriter examines the form and other documents and then determines the terms on which to accept the risk or reject the same. The consent of the person assured is obtained in the form of payment of premium. After receiving the payment, the insurance company issues the first premium receipt, which acknowledges the proposal of the assured. It contains all particulars of the policy. It has the details of the next premium to be paid. The first premium receipt is an important and powerful document on the basis of which the assured can ask the insurer to issue the policy bond, which is treated as evidence of the contract of insurance.</p>
            <p>First premium receipt is also called conditional binding receipt. A conditional binding receipt is involved in life, health and certain property insurance contracts; if the insured is deemed to be covered by the insurer, the coverage begins on the date the insured receives the conditional binding receipt. Typically, a premium payment must be received by the insurer along with a completed acceptable application in order for the insured to obtain the receipt. If a premium accompanies an application, a conditional binding receipt provides that coverage will be in force from the date of application or medical examination, as long the insurer would have issued the coverage on the basis of the facts revealed on the application, medical examination and other usual sources of underwriting information. A life and health insurance policy without a conditional binding receipt is not effective until itis delivered to the insured and the premium is paid. As long as the insured is going to receive the policy anyway, the insurer is obliged to cover a claim should one occur between the time the application is received and the time the policy is officially in place. If, however, the insured is denied coverage as the typical underwriting process progresses, the insurer could nullify the conditional binding receipt, even if a premium was collected. </p>
            <p>Further the function of a conditional binding receipt can actually be divided into two separate receipts, a conditional receipt and a binding receipt. The conditional receipt is most common. Under a conditional receipt, the applicant and the insurance company form a conditional contract that is contingent upon the conditions that existed when an application or medication exam is completed. It provides that the applicant is covered immediately as long as they pass the insurer's underwriting requirements. It is the insurance agent's responsibility to tell the applicant they are covered on the condition they prove to be insurable and pass a medical exam, if one is required. A conditional receipt gives an insurance company a window of time in which they can ultimately issue or refuse to approve the policy. If, during this time, the applicant for a life insurance contract dies, the company will pay a death benefit if the policy would have been issued. A binding receipt states an insurance policy is effective upon receipt of an initial premium payment. However, should the insured die before the application is processed; benefits are fully payable, subject to limitations. The binding receipt binds an insurer to the agreement unconditionally when benefits are due up to the limits of the policy.</p>
            <p>Renewal premiums are the subsequent premiums that are paid by the insured to the insurer in order to keep the policy in operation and avail the benefits of the policy accordingly. The renewal premium receipt shows the amount of premium that the insured has paid for the policy. It can be submitted as an investment proof to the taxation authority for receiving tax benefits.</p>
            <h3 id="three121">Insurance Policy</h3>
            <p>Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company.  Insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured, known as the policyholder, which determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay. In exchange for an initial payment, known as the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered under the policy.

              <li>Amount of premium</li>
              <li>Mode of premium payment and </li>
              <li>Deductibles, if any</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The contract sets out the terms and conditions under which you agree to pay a premium to the insurance company, and the terms and conditions under which the insurance company agrees to compensate you for loss after an unforeseen event. All insurance policies include terms and conditions that describe the ways in which the policy will operate and specify what is included and what is not, what the insurance company promises to do and what the policyholder promises to do. All insurance policies have certain basic components, usually in the following order</p>
            <ul>
              <p><li>Recital Clause:</li>This is also known as the preamble. It gives a start for arriving at the operative clause (the scope of cover provided under the policy is mentioned, followed up by exceptions to indicate the precise range of cover) by saying that as the insured has made a proposal and declaration (which shall form the basis of the contract) for taking out a policy of insurance and as he has paid or agreed to pay the premium, therefore, the insurer agrees to provide him cover in respect of loss, damage or destruction etc. as per the Operative Clause</p>
              <p><li>Declarations:</li>Identifies who is an insured, the insured's address, the insuring company, what risks or property are covered, the policy limits (amount of insurance), any applicable deductibles, the policy period and premium amount. These are usually provided on a form that is filled out by the insurer based on the insured's application and attached on top of or inserted within the first few pages of the policy.</p>
              <P><li>Definitions:</li>Defines important terms used in the rest of the policy.</P>
              <P><li>Insuring Agreement:</li>Describes the covered perils, or risks assumed, or nature of coverage. This is where the insurance company makes one or more express promises to indemnify the insured.</P>
              <p><li>Exclusions:</li>The exclusions section tells what is not covered under the policy. Exclusions takes coverage away from the insuring agreement by describing property, perils, hazards or losses arising from specific causes which are not covered by the policy.</p>
              <p><li>Terms and Conditions:</li>These are fundamental components of the insurance contract. If you do not comply with the terms and conditions of the policy, you may be in breach of the contract with the insurer. This may mean that the insurer is not obliged to fulfill its promise and pay out some or all of your claim. These are specific provisions, rules of conduct, duties, and obligations which the insured must comply with in order for coverage to incept, or must remain in compliance with in order to keep coverage in effect. Terms and conditions may be found throughout the policy and are important areas to highlight for reference in the case of a loss, because they often outline exactly what requirements must be met in order to ensure coverage.</p>
              <p><li>Endorsements:</li>Additional forms attached to the policy that modify it in some way, either unconditionally or upon the existence of some condition.</p>
              <p><li>Riders:</li>A rider is used to convey the terms of a policy amendment and the amendment thereby becomes part of the policy.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three131">Endorsements</h3>
            <p>An insurance endorsement is an amendment or addition to an existing insurance contract which changes the terms or scope of the original policy. Endorsements may also be referred to as riders. The purpose of an endorsement is a policy change. An insurance endorsement may be used to add, delete, exclude or otherwise alter coverage. An insurance endorsement may be issued mid-term, at the time of purchase, or at renewal. The insurance endorsement is a legally binding amendment to the insurance contract.  Insurance companies create endorsements to offer options to the insured to add coverage or increase coverage limits, but insurers may also issue special endorsements to limit or restrict coverage. Insurance policy endorsements may serve any number of functions, including broadening the scope of coverage, limiting or restricting the scope of coverage, clarifying the application of coverage to some unique loss exposure, adding other parties as insured, or adding locations to the policy. An endorsement alters the policy and becomes part of your legal insurance contract. It remains in force until the expiry of the policy and may renew under the same terms and conditions as the rest of your policy. The exception to this is if the endorsement specifies a specific term which the endorsement is valid. Endorsements can be divided into categories based on their purpose. Most fall into one of the following groups,</p>
            <ul>
              <p><li>Exclusions:</li>Many endorsements are intended to exclude coverage for certain types of claims.</p>
              <p><li>Added Coverage:</li>Endorsements are used to add a type of coverage that is not provided by the basic policy.</p>
              <p><li>Modification of Coverage:</li>Some endorsements expand the existing coverage.. Other endorsements reduce the scope of coverage. For instance, an insurer attaches an endorsement to a general liability policy that replaces the standard contractual liability exclusion with one that is more restrictive.</p>
              <p><li>Editorial Changes:</li>Some endorsements are added to clarify the intent of the policy without altering the coverage. The insurer uses an endorsement to replace one word or phrase with another.</p>
              <p><li>Administrative Changes:</li>Endorsements may be added for administrative purposes, such as changing the insurer's mailing address or correcting the name of the policyholder.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three141">Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938 (Rebating)</h3>
            <p>Rebating is returning a portion of the premium or the agent's/broker's commission on the premium to the insured or other inducements to place business with a specific insurer.  In the insurance business, rebating is a practice whereby something of value is given to sell the policy that is not provided for in the policy itself. An example of rebating is when the prospective insurance buyer receives a refund of all or part of the commission for the insurance sale. Rebates can be made in the form of cash, gifts, services, payment of premiums, employment, or almost any other thing of value.  Rebating is illegal and no intermediary is allowed to induce anyone to take a policy. Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938 is hence an important section for an insurance agent. As per Section 41 of the Insurance Act, 1938, Prohibition of rebates means</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>No person shall allow or offer to allow, either directly or indirectly, as an inducement to any person to take out or renew or continue an insurance in respect of any kind of risk relating to lives or property in India, any rebate of the whole or part of the commission payable or any rebate of the premium shown on the policy, nor shall any person taking out or renewing or continuing a policy accept any rebate, except such rebate as may be allowed in accordance with the published prospectuses or tables of the insurer: Provided that acceptance by an insurance agent of commission in connection with a policy of life insurance taken out by himself on his own life shall not be deemed to be acceptance of a rebate of premium within the meaning of this sub section if at the time of such acceptance the insurance agent satisfies the prescribed conditions establishing that he is a bona fide insurance agent employed by the insurer.</li>
              <li>Any person making default in complying with the provisions of this section shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="three151">Insurance Claim</h3>
            <p>An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. An insurance claim is when you have a loss or sustain damage that is caused by a peril insured by your insurance policy. The insurance policy provides coverage and compensation to the insured for covered losses or the damages that he/she sustains by way of he/she making a claim. The insurance company validates the claim and, once approved, issues payment to the insured or an approved interested party on behalf of the insured. Insurance claims cover everything from death benefits on life insurance policies to routine and comprehensive medical exams. In many cases, third-parties file claims on behalf of the insured person, but usually only the person(s) listed on the policy is entitled to claim payments.</p>
            <h3 id="three161">Intimation of Claim</h3>
            <p>Claim intimation is the first step of any notification of the claim to the insurer. This is often called as First Notification of Loss (FNOL). Notification of the claim does not necessarily mean the insurance company is paying for the loss. Claim accepted means the insurer has agreed to consider the claim for payout. The insurance company has to go through the formalities of investigating into the validity of the claim made, before accepting the responsibility of paying the amount. This is when we term it as claims intimated but not accepted. In due course, claims intimated may be accepted by the company. However, the amount is not yet paid and is still due to the insured. This is termed as claims intimated, accepted but not paid.</p>
            <p>A policyholder is supposed to inform an insurance company as soon as a claim occurs. So, if you, for instance, damage your car in an accident, you need to inform the insurer quickly. Or, if you are hospitalized and pay for the bills, you need to inform the insurer quickly to process the reimbursement if you have a health insurance policy. Insurers like to know as soon as the claim is made so that they can get into the thick of things and investigate all documents and assess the losses. Also, if there is no deadline, then the insurers would not know their liabilities and won’t be able to provision for it. So while some insurers may not specify the time within which you are supposed to intimate a claim, some insurers may put it down clearly. When you sign up for the policy, this is a question you need to ask and get an answer to. For instance, in the case of reimbursement, a health insurance policy document states that notice of claim should be made within 72 hours before admission in case of planned hospitalisation and not later than 48 hours or before discharge in case of emergency hospitalisation. Subsequently the claim documents need to be submitted within 30 days from the date of discharge. If an insurer spells out a timeline and the insured does not inform the insurer about the claim within that, the claim is considered delayed.</p>
            <p>If you delay, then on technical grounds the insurer can reject a claim. However, IRDAI, while recognizing the importance of having a deadline to intimate a claim with all the relevant documents, held the view that this should not prevent insurers from settling genuine claims where there was a delay in intimating a claim due to unavoidable circumstances. Accordingly, the regulator directed the insurer to not reject paying out delayed claims until the reasons for delay are ascertained and the insurer is sure that the delayed claim would have been rejected even if it was reported on time. Accordingly, insurers were instructed to incorporate additional wordings in the policy document, stating that a delayed claim will be paid where the delay is proven to be for reasons beyond the control of the policyholder. Irdai recently reiterated its stance regarding handling of delayed claims. While regulations protect the insured against a delay due to unavoidable circumstances, it is always advisable to intimate a claim as soon as possible. </p>
            <h3 id="three171">Appointment of a Surveyor</h3>
            <p>Surveyors are professionals who assess the loss or damage and serve as a link between the insurer and the insured. They usually function only in non-life business. Their job is to assess the actual loss and avoid false claims. Surveyors like agents, are not employees but are independent professionals hired by the insurance company. A person intending to act as a surveyor and loss assessor (S& LA) in respect of general insurance has to apply to the IRDAI for the grant of license to act as such. IRDAI shall satisfy itself that the applicant, in addition to submitting the application complete in all respects:- satisfies all the applicable requirements of section 64UM read with section 42D of the Act and rule 56A of the Insurance Rules, 1939;possesses such additional technical qualifications as may be specified by IRDAI from time to time; has furnished evidence of payment of fees for grant of license, depending upon the categorization; has undergone a period of practical training, not exceeding 12 months, as contained in Chapter VII of these regulations; and furnishes such additional information as may be required by IRDAI from time to time.</p>
            <p>The insurance regulator has rolled out new guidelines on appointment of surveyors and assessors for assessing a loss in a general insurance policy. Recently a rule was passed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) vide circular dated July 14th, 2015, stating that claim amount should not exceed an amount specified by the regulator, unless the claim settlement report is obtained from a person who holds license to act as surveyor and loss assessor. The guidelines of appointment of surveyor’s state</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Surveyors and Loss Assessors shall be appointed either by insurers or insured to assess loss for policies having premium above Rs. 20,000 </li>
              <li>Insured or claimant needs to notify claim to the insurer in the stipulated time allowed by insurer. Upon claim notification, the insurer should immediately respond to the insured or claimant, about any further requirements. In case, if surveyor is required to be appointed to assess the claim, the insurers needs to appoint the person within 72 hours of the receipt of intimation from the insured or claimant. </li>
              <li>Appointment of Surveyors and Loss Assessors should not be outsourced by the insurers.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities of a Surveyor</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>He should investigate, quantify, validate and deal with losses and report thereon; carry out the work with competence, objectivity and professional integrity by strictly adhering to the Code of Conduct.</li>
              <li>He should maintain confidentiality and neutrality without jeopardizing the liability of the Insurer and the claim of the Insured.</li>
              <li>He should examine, inquire, investigate, and verify the cause and circumstances of the loss including extent of loss, nature of ownership and insurable interest.</li>
              <li>He should estimate, measure and determine the quantum and description of the loss.</li>
              <li>He should comment on the admissibility of the loss and also whether conditions and warranties have been observed under the policy.</li>
              <li>He should assess the liability under the contract of insurance and also point out discrepancies, if any, in the policy wordings.</li>
              <li>He should give reasons for repudiation of a claim in case the claim is not covered under the policy terms and conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="three181">Survey Report</h3>
            <p>A surveyor and loss assessor, whether appointed by insurer or insured, is expected to submit the report to the insurer within 30 days of being appointed—and a copy of the report to the insured as well, with comments on the assessment of loss. If required, the surveyor can seek an extension while keeping the insured informed about the same. However, regardless of any extensions, a surveyor has to submit the report within 6 months from the date of appointment.  If the insurance company finds a survey report to be incomplete, it can ask the surveyor for an additional report, which needs to be submitted within 3 weeks. Such an additional report can be sought only one time during a single claim cycle. </p>
            <p>A surveyor’s job is first to assess the quantum of loss and then comment on the admissibility of the claim i.e. Whether, in his opinion, the losses are due to the peril covered by the policy and are payable under the terms of the policy. His report is recommendatory. He assesses the liability on the basis of physical inspection and going through the books of account and other relevant documents and explanations given by the client to substantiate the loss. His job is to strictly go by the wordings of the policy, though he may make additional comments and observations relevant to the loss. Any genuine losses the client may have suffered, which could not be substantiated at the time of the survey, can still be taken up with the insurance company. If the quantum of loss is in dispute and/or the insurer is not convinced by the client or vice versa, legal recourse is available under the arbitration clause. The surveyor only assesses the loss and recommends an amount. It is for the insurer to accept it or otherwise. After all, it is the insurance company which ultimately picks up the tab and not the surveyor.</p>
            <p>The insurance company cannot ignore the report in toto if it is based on facts and figures. However, it can always call for additional information from the surveyor or the insured if it is not satisfied with the loss assessment or even go for second opinion or assessment. It can also obtain a specialist’s opinion. In an extreme situation, where it has strong reasons to do so (eg; mala fide on the part of the surveyor), it can ignore the report and order a fresh survey to be conducted.</p>
            <p>While the surveyor’s report definitely is privileged and confidential (except in case of marine losses) and the insurance company may not divulge all the details of the report; it is definitely bound to furnish to the insured the working of the claim amount i.e. How the surveyor has arrived at a particular figure of the final claim amount. Contrary to popular belief, the insured can demand a resurvey if they feel that the surveyor has grossly erred in assessing the loss. The insured will have to convince the insurer that there was a gross mistake in assessing the loss. Some of the large broking houses have a panel of surveyors whose help can be taken by the corporate in event of a claim. In the event of a loss, the surveyors can work with the corporate in properly presenting the claim to the surveyor deployed by the insurance company. If the papers are presented in sync with the requirements of the surveyor, it helps him in getting more focused and the turnaround time for submission of the report and the settlement of the claim is drastically reduced.</p>
            <h3 id="three191">Claim Forms</h3>
            <p>A claim form which has to be filled in when making an insurance claim. The content of the claim form vary with each class of insurance. In general the claim form is designed to get full information regarding the circumstances of the loss, such as date of loss, time, cause of loss, extent of loss and so on. The other questions vary from one class of insurance to another. In addition to claim forms certain documents are required to be submitted or secured by the insurer to substantiate the claim. For example, for fire claims, a report	from the fire brigade would be necessary; for cyclone damage, a report from the meteorological office may be called for; in burglary claims, a report from the police may be necessary; for motor claims the insurer may like to examine driving licence, police report, RC, and son on; in marine cargo claims the number of documents varies according to the type of loss i.e. total loss, particular average, inland or overseas transit claims and so on.</p>

            <p>Important aspects in an insurance claim</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first aspect to be decided is whether loss is within the scope of the policy. The legal doctrine of proximate cause provides guidelines to decide whether the loss is caused by an insured peril or an excluded peril. The burden of proof that the loss is within the scope of the policy is upon the insured. However, if the loss is caused by an excluded peril the onus of proof is on the insurer.</li>
              <li>The second aspect to be decided is whether the insured has complied with policy conditions especially conditions which are precedent to liability.</li>
              <li>The third aspect is in respect is in respect of compliance with warranties. The survey report would indicate whether or not warranties have been complied with.</li>
              <li>The fourth aspect relates to the observance of utmost good faith by the proposer, during the currency of the policy. </li>
              <li>On the occurrence of a loss, the insured is expected to act as if is uninsured. In other words, he has a duty to take measure 	to minimise the loss.</li>
              <li>The last aspect concerns the determination of the amount payable. The amount of loss payable is subject to the sum insured. However the amount payable will also depend upon the following. The extent of the insured’s insurable interest in the property affected; the value of salvage; application of underinsurance and application of contribution and subrogation conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>Investigation is different from the assessment of loss. Investigation is done to ensure that a valid claim has been made verify the important details and doubts such as absence of insurable interest, suppression or misrepresentation of material facts, deliberately creating the loss and so on are ruled out. </P>
            <P>Motor third party claims involving death and personal injuries are assessed on the basis of doctor’s report. These claims are dealt by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and the amount to be paid is decided by factors like the age and income of the claimant. Claims involving third party property damage are assessed on the basis of a survey report. Motor own damage claim is assessed on the basis of surveyors report. It may require police report if third party damage is involved. Health insurance claims are assessed either in house or by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) on behalf of the non-life insurance companies. The assessment is based on the medical reports and expert opinion.</P>
            <h3 id="three201">Section 64 UM of the Insurance Act, 1938</h3>
            <p>Where, incase of a claim of less than INR 20,000/- in value on any policy of insurance it is not practicable for an insurer to employ an approved surveyor or loss assessor without incurring expenses disproportionate to the amount of claim, the insurer may employ any other person (not being a person disqualified for the time being for being employed as surveyor or loss assessor) for surveying such loss and may pay such reasonable fee or remuneration to the person so  employed as he may think fit.</p>
            <p><strong>Categories of Claims</strong></p>
            <p>The claims which are dealt with in insurance policies fall into the following categories.</p>
            <p><strong>Standard Clams: </strong> These are claims which are clearly within the terms and conditions of the policy. The assessment of claim is done keeping in view the scope and the sum insured opted for and other methods indemnity laid down for various classes of insurance. The claim payable by the insurer takes in	to account various factors like valuation at time of the loss, insurable interest, salvage prospects, loss of earnings, loss of use, depreciation, replacement value 	depending on the policy taken</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Standard Claims:</strong> These are claims where the insured must have committed breach of condition or warranty. The settlement of these claims is considered subject to rules and regulations framed by non-life insurance companies</p>
            <p><strong>Condition of Average or Average Clause:</strong> This is a condition in some policies which penalises the insured for insuring property at sum insured less than its actual value known as underinsurance. In the event of a claim the insured gets an amount that is proportionately reduced from his actual loss in accordance to the amount underinsured.</p>
            <p><strong>Acts of God Perils – Catastrophic Losses:</strong> Natural perils such as storm, cyclone, flood inundation and earthquake are termed as ‘acts of God’ perils. These perils may result in losses to many policies of insurer in the affected region. In such major catastrophic losses, the surveyor is asked to proceed to the loss site immediately for an early assessment and loss minimisation efforts. Simultaneously, insurers’ officials also visit the scene of loss particularly when the amount involved is large. The purpose of the visit is to obtain an immediate, on the spot idea of the nature and extent of loss.</p>
            <h3 id="three211">Discharge Vouchers</h3>
            <p>Settlement of claim is made only after obtaining a discharge under the policy. A discharge voucher represents culmination of insurance claim, which is evidence of payment. Wherever there are no disputes by the insured/s or claimant/s to the amount offered by the insurer towards settlement of a claim, the present system of obtaining the discharge voucher may be continued, IRDAI said. The insurers must ensure that the vouchers collected are dated and complete in all respects while obtaining the signature/s of the insured persons or claimant(s). In case the amount offered is disputed by the insured or claimant, insurers should take steps to pay the amount assessed without waiting for the voucher discharged. However, under no circumstances the discharge vouchers shall be collected under duress, by coercion, by force or compulsion, from the insured.</p>
            <h3 id="three221">Payment of Claim</h3>
            <p>A claim and its payment are the end result of the insurance process. With respect to life insurance, this means that the insured has died and the beneficiary is in line to collect from the insurer what is due. Unlike property or casualty insurance, claims made on a life insurance policy are rarely negotiated. They are either paid or denied. When proof of the death of the insured arrives at the insurer's claims department, the records are checked to validate that the policy was in force at the time of death and ensure that the person to whom the policy proceeds are to be paid is the rightful beneficiary.</p>
            <p>When an insured dies, the life insurance company should be notified as soon as is possible and practical. Once the company has received the proper forms, there's usually little or no delay in payment of the claim, especially when it's obvious that the claim is valid – the policy is in force, the beneficiary is available, there's no evidence of suicide within the limitations of the contract's suicide clause, and so on. Valid life insurance claims are generally paid in relatively short order, usually within a few days. This policy also helps to foster goodwill with the public, which is one of the life insurance industry's most valuable selling tools.</p>
            <p>In the fields of property or casualty insurance, the amount of individual claims paid is often less than the face amount of the policy. In contrast, life insurance is generally paid at the full face value of the policy. There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule: the first is when there's an outstanding loan against the cash value of the policy. The amount of the loan, along with any unpaid interest, is deducted from the policy's face amount before payment is made to the beneficiary. The second exception is if there's a premium payment due. Insurance contracts often extend a grace period of up to a month after passing of the premium due date before the policy lapses. If the insured dies within this grace period, the amount of the premium due would be deducted from the policy's face amount before payment is made to the beneficiary.</p>
            <p>The third exception that would prevent a life insurance policy's full-face value from being paid is when an error was made in determining the age or gender of the insured at the time the policy was issued. If such an error is discovered upon the insured's death, the insurance company will compute the face amount that the premium would have purchased if the accurate information was originally used and pay that amount to the beneficiary. Such occurrences are actually not that unusual. Some may be intentional, but most are simply mistakes. In either case, the discrepancy is not deemed material enough to completely void the policy.</p>
            <p>In indemnity policies, the upper limit of a claim is the sum assured and this usually applies for the period of the policy. Certain policies, however, allow for reinstatement of the Sum Insured by payment of proportionate premium for the remaining period of the policy. The actual claim will be the actual extent of financial loss as validated by documents like bills. If the property is underinsured, the insured shall bear a rate able proportion of the loss. There can be more than one claim in the policy period but the sum assured is usually the limit for the policy period unless reinstated. Nowadays health insurance policies - which cover hospitalisation costs - have also a cashless settlement of claims. That is, you don't have to pay for the treatment at the hospital and then make a claim for reimbursement of the expenses. The insurance company has a service provider called the third party administrator (TPA) health services, who liaises with the hospitals and directly makes the payment for your treatment as per the terms of your policy and coverage.</p>

It protects a policy holder against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death to a third party or any damage to property. Here third party includes people travelling with you or whom the insured person injures and claims damages at the time of accident. But this insurance does not protect you, your vehicle and co-passengers against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death.</p>
            <p><strong>Comprehensive Insurance:</strong>This type of insurance will cover third party liabilities as well as damages caused to you and your car. You will receive financial protection against liabilities arising from natural disasters, theft, and accidents. Comprehensive insurance plans include third-party premium and own-damage premium. Own-damage premium is determined based on the age of the car, make and model of the car, geographical location, and engine capacity. The comprehensive car insurance policy offers personal accident cover for the owner-driver. In case you require personal accident cover for the passengers, you will have to take that coverage separately after paying extra premium</p>
            <p><strong>Two Wheeler Insurance</strong>Two wheeler insurance is essentially a method of protecting your two wheeler from accidents, theft, natural disasters, and other such perils. The owner of the two wheeler will buy an insurance policy from an insurance company. As per this contract, the insurance company offers financial protection to the policyholder in the event of several incidents involving the insured vehicle. This includes accidents, natural disasters, theft, man-made calamities, in-transit damages, and third-party liability claims for loss of life, injuries, and property damage. In return, the policyholder pays a premium to the insurance company. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, all vehicles in India are mandated to have at least third-party liability insurance cover. Riding a bike without insurance can attract heavy penalties. Apart from being the law, two wheeler insurance is an essential investment as it provides the rider complete peace of mind when he/she is on the road. The protection that the insurance offers against third-party liability claims is noteworthy.</p>

            <p><strong>Liability-Only Insurance:</strong>Also referred to as third party liability insurance, this standalone plan offers protection to the insured vehicle from legal liabilities to a third party that arise from accidents.

Third party insurance is compulsory under Indian law and all two wheelers are required to have this form of insurance.

The protection offered by one part of this insurance is similar to that offered by the standalone liability-only plan explained above. It protects the bike owner from liabilities to a third party due to accidental injuries, death, or property damage. The other part of the insurance plan protects the insured vehicle from a host of events, including accidents, theft, in-transit damages, natural disasters, man-made calamities, etc. The vehicle owner is also offered Personal Accident cover under this scheme. Comprehensive two-wheeler insurance covers damage to the vehicle arising out of natural and man-made calamities as well as coverage for the owner and rider. Comprehensive bike insurance provides complete protection in the event of an accident resulting in partial or total damage to the insured vehicle.

With a two-wheeler comprehensive insurance policy, you can enjoy good protection for your vehicle when it is stolen, damaged, or lost.

            <p><strong>Term Insurance</strong></p>

In the event of death of term insurance policyholder during policy term, the beneficiary can claim death benefits from the insurance company.

A term insurance plan is the most affordable form of life insurance cover. It is designed to financially protect ones family in case of death of the bread-earner</p>
            <p><strong>Features of Term Insurance Plan</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Flexible Payment Options:</strong>Term insurance policies offer flexible premium payment options, allowing policyholders to choose a payment plan based on their convenience. Premiums can be either limited pay, single pay or regular pay plans. Policyholders who choose limited or regular pay plans can pay their premiums either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.</p>
            <p><strong>High Sum Assured for Low Premiums:</strong>Term insurance premiums are some of the lowest in the insurance sector, allowing for a prudent and relatively inexpensive way to safeguard the policyholder’s dependents in case of untimely demise. The Sum Assured associated with term insurance plans are also relatively high when compared to the premium amounts. Regular plans as well as TROP plans offer as much as 105% return on premiums paid as a benefit upon maturity.</p>
            <p><strong>Choice of Plan:</strong>A number of insurers offer policyholders a choice when it comes to the type of plan they wish to opt for. Policyholders can choose between single or joint life plans, depending on their need. They can thus choose to extend coverage for dependent spouses or choose a plan exclusively for the breadwinner of the family.</p>
            <p><strong>Death Benefit:</strong>On the death of the policyholder during the policy term, his/her dependents stand to receive the amount chosen at the time of choosing the policy. The amount would depend on the term plan, with the amount increasing, decreasing or remaining the same irrespective of at what juncture of the policy tenure the policyholder’s death occurs.</p>
            <p><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong>Policyholders can claim tax exemptions under various sections by virtue of opting for a term insurance policy. Tax exemptions can be got under section 80C of the Income Tax Act on premium amounts. Policyholders can also claim exemptions under Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act for benefits received through insurance policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Survival Benefits:</strong>While a regular term insurance plan does not have any survival benefits, a number of insurers have designed plans that also offer survival benefits in the form of premium refunds on maturity. On maturity of the policy, surviving policyholders stand to receive benefits under a TROP policy only. In the case of a TROP policy, the policyholder will receive the premium amount paid over the policy tenure as one lump sum.</p>
            <p><strong>Add-on Benefits: A number of individuals have begun to opt for add-on features to their regular term insurance policies. These add-on plans will push up the price of the premium being paid but provide additional benefits in case of accidental death, critical illness, total and permanent disability benefit etc.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Types of Term Insurance Plans</strong>Insurance companies offer a wide range of term insurance plans with exciting features and benefits to stand out amongst competitors in the insurance space. Term insurance can be classified into the following types:</p>
            <p><strong>Regular Term Insurance Plans:</strong>A regular term insurance plan is a no-frills insurance plan that provides coverage against a specific set of risks on payment of a pre-decided premium amount. These plans offer no benefits upon maturity. Premium payments can be made periodically or they can be paid at once (single pay). The options for insurance cover can go as high as the insurer is willing to underwrite and the policy tenures can be as high as 20 years. When the policy matures, the insurance cover ceases, as does the need to pay premiums for such a cover. This is the most basic form of life insurance protection. Regular term insurance also comes with low premiums and high sum assured. This ensures that the policyholder can receive maximum benefits from the plan in a cost-effective manner.</p>
            <p><strong>Group Term Insurance Plans:</strong>Group Term Insurance policies are offered to a group of individuals by an employing organisation, association, or trusts and societies. It provides coverage to each and every member insured under the plan. It is also less expensive compared to an individual term insurance plan. Group term plans offer more or less the same benefits as individual plans, however, the only disadvantage is that the coverage expires once the employment or membership ends. As is made obvious by the name, a group term insurance plan is meant to be an insurance instrument that can be used by a group to secure its members against untoward occurrences. These plans can be taken by any group of people or companies for their employees but can come with one essential clause or mandate set by the insurer where the policy will require a minimum number of people participating in it. For example, if a policy says that it will cover groups of at least 20 people then a small company that has less than 20 employees won’t be able to purchase the policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Convertible Term Insurance Plans:</strong>A convertible term plan allows the policyholder to convert his/her policy into a permanent one during the policy tenure. Some insurers provide this as an additional benefit rider while others offer the same as a standalone plan. As far as the terms and conditions have been met, converting a term life policy into a permanent policy should not be a difficult process.</p>
            <p><strong>Term Return of Premium (TROP):</strong>TROP plans are standard term life insurance plans with a slight variation in the method of providing survival benefits. On survival, policyholders are returned the total amount of premiums paid by them during the policy tenure, excluding tax. Such a method ensures that the money spent on the policy is returned to you after a specific interval.</p>
            <p><strong>Decreasing and Increasing Term Plans:</strong>The insurance market is flooded with various types of policies that it often becomes difficult for the buyer to choose the best suited plan. Decreasing and increasing insurance policies are two of the commonly used terms in the insurance realm. Let’s take a look at the features and benefits of the aforementioned policies:</p>

            <p><strong>Decreasing Term Insurance:</strong>In this type of policy, the sum assured on death as well as the premium decreases at a certain rate throughout the policy term. Such plans are generally offered by financial institutions to insure the property held as collateral against the loan offered. It is an additional safety component which ensures that the bank will get back the amount released as loan, in case of the worst scenario. The duration of the policy term can vary between 1 and 30 years. The essence of decreasing term insurance is that a person’s requirement for high insurance coverage decreases with age, as certain liabilities do not exist beyond a point. Decreasing term insurance plans are not suitable for individuals who have no other form of life coverage. If you buy only one life insurance package, it should be a pure term insurance policy, as it would offer you a level death benefit throughout the tenure. While the main advantage of choosing decreasing term insurance is that it can be used for personal asset protection, small businesses also use these plans to insure indebtedness for startup expenses or operational costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Increasing Term Insurance:</strong>Under increasing term insurance plans, the insurance coverage increases at specified durations when the policy is in full force. It evaluates risks on par with the rising costs at any given time in the future and compensates accordingly. The cover usually keeps increasing till the time it attains a value which is 1.5 times higher than the original cover. Increasing term life insurance policies are configured to offer respite from inflation. It also ensures that the death benefit is substantial when it is finally paid out to the nominee. One of the main disadvantages of the increasing term insurance plan is that the premium increases according to the benefit. Hence, these policies get more expensive over time. Increasing term insurance is less common than other forms of term insurance. These plans are particularly suitable for couples who plan to have a child in the near future, and would like to save up for the same.</p>
            <p><strong>Joint Term Insurance Plans:</strong>As the name suggests, joint term insurance plans are those schemes which allow the person insured to cover his/her spouse under the same policy. It is a comprehensive financial protection solution with multiple benefits for couples. It basically ensures that the family equilibrium remains intact during hardships, or in the worst case, during the absence of one of the two or both. These policies are well suited for married couples with dependent children.</p>

            <h3 id="five11">Grievances Redressal Mechanism</h3>
            <p>Grievance Redress Mechanism is part and parcel of the administrative machinery of every business entity. No such entity can claim to be accountable, responsive and user friendly unless it has established an efficient and effective grievance redress mechanism. The insurance industry essentially being a service industry can exist and survive only if there is a customer. In this people-centric business where the customer expectations are ever rising grievances are bound to arise. And if customer has a grievance and that grievance is not satisfied it may lead to fall in the reputation of the insurance company and resultant loss of customer. Therefore, handling customer grievance is very important in insurance. To redress these grievances and to lubricate the insurance machinery grievance redressal mechanism has been provided for insurance disputes. The grievance redressal mechanism for insurance related dispute has been gathered hereafter.</p>
            <p><strong>(a) Grievance Redressal Cell of Insurers</strong></p>
            <p>It is incumbent upon the insurers on continuous basis to have in place an independent and transparent grievance redress machinery to resolve grievances in conformity with Redress of Public Grievances Rules, 1998. Apart from this, Regulation 5 of the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders Interests) Regulations, 2006, stipulate that every insurer shall have in place, proper procedures and effective mechanism to address complaints and grievances of policyholders efficiently and with speed. So, every insurer must establish a ‘grievance cell’ at their office in order to address the grievances and problems of their policyholders. These in house grievance redress units are fully aligned with the IRDAI guidelines on grievance redressal and have excellent setup to handle customer grievances. The annual reports of the IRDAI contain information about the number of grievances received by the public and private insurers, grievances settled and disposed and those pending with them. In order to improve grievance settlement mechanism in the industry, the IRDAI appointed a Committee to Look into Grievance Redressal System of insurers and suggest modifications of the regulations for the protection of policyholders.</p>
            <p>Insurance Companies are committed to resolve grievance in a cost effective and impartial manner. As a matter of fact, even before any difference of opinion between the insurer and insured graduates to a grievance to be resolved by ‘In-house Grievance Redressal Machinery’ the organization is required to provide credible arrangement for expeditious hearing of such difference of opinion and address the issues through negotiations, promptly and impartially.  Insurance companies look into and resolve the grievances of their prospective and existing customers who have any issue regarding their products and services before, during and afterwards. They track and monitor the complaints and coordinate to resolve the complaints within the time frame mentioned in the policy. An in-depth analysis of the complaint is done to identify the root cause of complaint and identify issues pertaining to products, process and system. They also conduct a trend analysis of the complaints received and give suitable directions to the various departments to heal the trouble.  However, if the in-house grievance redressal mechanism fails to resolve the grievance amicably or fails to respond to the insured within 30 days, the aggrieved insured has a right to make complaint for amicable resolution at industry level through ‘insurance ombudsman’ so as to get rid of the conflict of interest between insured and insurer. Apart from this, the IRDAI has also established its own grievance cell at its headquarters for discontented insurance customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
            <p>Every company has instituted an in-house grievance settlement procedure. And the policyholders who have a complaint against the insurer are required to first approach the Grievance/Customer Complaint Cell of the concerned insurer.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Every insurer shall have a board approved grievance redressal policy which shall be filed with IRDAI. The system and procedure for receiving, registering and disposing of grievances and other relevant details along with details of turnaround times shall be clearly mentioned in the policy.</li>
              <li>Every insurer shall have a designated Grievance Officer of a senior management level to hear the grievances of policyholders. Senior Management would mean either the CEO or the compliance Officer. </li>
              <li>An insurer shall send a written acknowledgement to a complainant within 3 working days of receipt of the grievance. The acknowledgement shall contain the name and designation of the officers who will deal with the grievance. It shall also contain details of the insurer’s grievance redressal procedure and the time taken for resolution of disputes. </li>
              <li>Where the insurer resolves the dispute within 3 working days, it may communicate the resolution along with acknowledgement. Where the grievance is not resolved within 3 working days, an insurer shall resolve the grievance within 2 weeks of its receipt or reject the complaint and gives reasons for doing so.</li>
              <li> The insurer shall inform the complainant about how he/she may pursue the complainant, if dissatisfied. The insurer shall inform that it will regard the complaint as closed if it does not receive a reply within 8 weeks from date of receipt of response by the insured/policyholder.</li>
              <li>Any failure on the part of insurers to follow the above-mentioned procedures and time frames would attract penalties by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.</li>
              <li>All insurers should publicize its grievance redressal procedure and ensure that it is specifically made available on website. It is also necessary for the insurers to have in place the automated system that will enable online registration, tracking of status of grievances by complainants and periodical reports prescribed by IRDAI.</li>
              <li>Insurers shall also have in place a system to receive and deal with all kinds of calls including voicemail, e-mail, relating to grievances from prospects and policyholders. The system should enable and facilitate the required interfacing with IRDAI’s system of handling calls and e-mails.</li>
              <li>However, if the policyholder do not receive a response from insurer within a reasonable time or are dissatisfied with the response of the company they may approach the grievance cell of IRDAI.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>(b) Grievance Redressal Cell of IRDAI</strong></p>
            <p>The interest of policyholder is on top of the agenda of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. IRDAI has established its own grievance cell at its headquarter for discontented insurance customers. A recent introduction by IRDAI for the facilitation of policyholder is IRDAI Grievance Call Centre (IGCC). IGCC acts as an additional and easily accessible channel for policy holders to lodge their grievances and also seek their status over phone/email. If need arises then investigations and inquiries are carried out by IRDAI as well</p>
            <p><strong>(c) Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) </strong></p>
            <p>Today, all major regulatory bodies are concerned about customer rights and fair trade. Almost all major regulators across industries have set up robust grievance management and redressal mechanisms to service and protect interests of end customers. The interest of policyholders is on top of the IRDAI’s agenda. These days IRDAI is investing in to execute Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) through automation of the Grievance Cell for on-line registration of complaints. IGMS will act as a gateway for policyholders to register their complaints with the insurance companies first and if required these complaints can then be escalated directly to the IGCC. With IGMS, you can also route your complaint. A complaint registered through IGMS will flow simultaneously to the insurers system as well as to IRDAI repository In fact, a media campaign has been launched in order to educate policyholders and publicise the regulating body’s grievance redressal mechanisms. Another initiative in this direction is the launch of the Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS), a platform to help customers lodge and track their complaints online. Additionally, the regulator also has a grievance cell, besides several Insurance Ombudsman offices. The IGMS put in place by IRDAI is the repository of the insurance industry complaints providing not only a platform to raise customer grievances with insurers but also to generate various, analytical reports on Customer grievances registered against the Insurers. If policyholders are not able to access the insurance company directly for any reason, IGMS provides a gateway to register complaints with insurance companies.</p>
            <p><strong>(d) Government Department of Administration Reforms and Public Grievances (DAPRG)</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance industry is essentially a service industry where, in the present context, customer expectations are constantly rising and dissatisfaction with the standard of services rendered is ever present. Despite there being continuous product innovation and significant improvement in the level of customer service aided by use of modern technology, the industry suffers badly in terms of customer dissatisfaction and poor image. Alive to this situation the government and the regulator have taken a number of initiatives.  Apart from the complaints registered in the IGMS Portal of IRDAI, Complaints registered in DARPG Portal against insurers are also referred to IRDAI. The Insurance regulatory body regularly accesses the portal of the DARPG and ensures that complaints relating to the insurance sector are downloaded and necessary action to get them examined by the insurers is taken.</p>
            <p><strong>(e) Consumer Forums</strong></p>
            <p>The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, was enacted with an objective to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the grievances of consumers. It covers goods and services, unless specifically exempted by the Central Government.  The Act establishes quasi-judicial authorities at the district, state and national levels to deal with consumer grievances. Insurance is one of the services enumerated in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and falls within the purview of the definition of ‘services’ under Sec. 2(1) (0). Insurance being a prime component of financial services, any beneficiary under such contract is considered to be an insurance consumer. The consumer law provides protection to all affected consumer whose insurance services suffer from the deficiencies and defects. The act however restricts the ambit and scope of the power of the consumer court to award compensation to the aggrieved policyholder. And, it is only when there is deficiency in the service rendered to him and he has suffered any loss or injury due to the negligence of the insurer that relief by way of compensation can be granted to him/her. In other words, the consumer is entitled to relief under the act if and only if he establishes that he hired the service complaint of and that the service provided to him has a deficiency. Consumer courts are the last resort for a policyholder. One need not approach the ombudsman before knocking on the consumer courts’ doors, one can do so directly. Approaching the consumer forum would be the simplest, fastest and most economical remedy. The forum is better accessible, and awards compensation and costs.  The insured can also approach consumer forums or civil courts for relief if the insurer fails to comply with the Ombudsman’s order or they are not satisfied with it.</p>
            <p><strong>(f) Arbitration on Quantum</strong></p>
            <p>Arbitration, a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), is a technique for the resolution of disputes outside the Courts, where the parties to a dispute refer it to one or more persons (the arbitrators or arbitral tribunal) by whose decision (the award) they agree to be bound. It is a resolution technique in which a third party reviews the evidence in the case and imposes a decision that is legally binding for both sides and is enforceable. These days, the use of Arbitration
              clause in consumer contracts is on the rise – it is commonly found in consumer contracts for insurance policies, gift redemption offers, or home or car loans from finance companies. The speedy resolution mechanism offered via arbitration as compared to resolution of disputes by Civil Courts makes it a popular choice for Indian Insurance Industry.  In sectors such as insurance the use of arbitration clause has a history. Insurance offerings were once covered by tariffs and required that disputes (largely relating to quantum) be resolved via arbitration. Even as insurance offerings have been de-tariffed since 2007, it is customary to continue with the arbitration clause.</p>
            <p><strong>(g) Lok Adalat</strong></p>
            <p>Lok Adalat literally means “People’s Court”. It is a court for the people, by the people and of the people themselves. It is a special kind of people’s court in which disputes are solved by direct talks between the litigants. In Lok Adalat, the procedural and perfunctory requirements of the proper court are done away with, and the cadaverous remains are fleshed out with flexibility and amenity in settlement, and this lends the Lok Adalat the characteristics of people friendliness. It is a mode of redressing grievances and delivering justice but it has nothing in common with the adjudicating machinery. In fact, Lok Adalats originated from the failure of the Indian Legal System to provide fast, effective and affordable justice. The evolution of this movement was a part of strategy to relieve the heavy burden on the courts with cases pending disposal. The Supreme Court has been promoting this forum as a part of an alternative disputes redressal mechanism to reduce the high pendency of cases in the subordinate courts. The pendency of the cases poses great difficulties to the judiciary and to the people who queue up in the hope of getting justice. Lok Adalat is a boon to litigant public where they can get their disputes settled fast and free of cost.</p>
            <p><strong>(h) Insurance Ombudsman</strong></p>
            <p>The first point of contact for a policyholder should always be the insurer. The traditional role of civil service which was of administrator, service provider and controller of development activities has to make way for the new roles of facilitator and regulator so as to create best environment and conditions in the country for building a nation of excellence. While consumer groups remain apprehensive about the steps being taken by the regulator to protect policyholders’ interests, these moves are definitely a step in the right direction. If a policyholder is unhappy with the company’s response, he can approach the insurance ombudsman in his city 30 days after you first lodged the complaint with the insurer. It is a quasi-judicial body which deals with cases up to a value of Rs 20 lakh and has the power to award compensation to aggrieved policyholders. The ombudsman primarily comes into the picture for complaints that involve monetary compensation; IGMS is the way to go for simpler complaints. The ombudsman framework has turned out to be as helpful as it was expected to be. Unlike the grievance cell, the Ombudsman does have the power to pass orders. Cases of up to Rs 20 lakh fall under the ambit of the Ombudsman’s powers. The Ombudsman addresses issues related to rejection or delay in the settlement of claims, disputes on premiums and non-issuance of a document after collecting the premium. Complaints have to be filed with the Ombudsman office under whose jurisdiction your complaint falls. Recommendations can be made within a month of the receipt of the complaint, while a verdict has to be given within three months. If the need arises, the Ombudsman can also award compensation to the policyholder. The Ombudsman is appointed by the Insurance Council and is supposed to be independent. The order passed by the Ombudsman is binding on the insurance company. It is up to the insured whether to accept the award or to file a consumer complaint if he/she is dissatisfied with such an award. If the verdict is acceptable to the insured, he/she is required to intimate the Ombudsman of this within 15 days.  This requires a paradigm shift in governance to a system where the citizen is in the centre and he is consulted at various stages of formulation and implementation of public policy. To achieve this objective, India needs a public service which is capable, innovative and forward looking.</p>

            <h3 id="five31">AML/KYC Norms</h3>
            <p><strong>(A) Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance for Insurance Companies</strong></p>
            <p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 brought into force with effect from 1st July2005 (amended from time to time). The act is applicable to all the financial institutions which include insurance companies: Life and Non-Life, Public Sector and private Sector. Insurance companies that issue or underwrite covered products that may pose a higher risk of money laundering must comply with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) program requirements. A covered product includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An annuity contract other than a group annuity contract</li>
              <li>A permanent life insurance policy other than a group life insurance policy</li>
              <li>Any other insurance product with cash value or investment features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Insurance regulations only apply to insurance companies, excluding agents and brokers from the requirements. However, insurance companies are held responsible for compliance with their program, which includes the activities of any agents and brokers. Insurance companies should therefore integrate their agents and brokers into their AML program.</p>
            <p><strong>Features of a BSA/AML Program</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance companies must develop a written, risk-based BSA/AML program addressing the covered insurance products. At a minimum, the program must consist of the following features,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A designated compliance officer responsible for effectively implementing the program</li>
              <li>Ongoing training of appropriate persons, including insurance agents and brokers</li>
              <li>Policies, procedures and internal controls tailored to the AML risks of the institution</li>
              <li>Independent testing to monitor ongoing compliance, including testing for compliance of insurance agents and brokers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)</strong></p>
            <p>Along with implementing an adequate BSA/AML program, insurance companies are subject to Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements. Companies are required to submit a SAR to the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Insurance companies must obtain relevant customer information from agents, brokers and any other sources to report such transactions. The following are the list of suspicious activity that must be reported</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Customer insisting on anonymity, reluctance to provide identifying information, or providing minimal, seemingly fictitious information</li>
              <li>Cash based suspicious transactions for payment / multiple DDs each denominated for less than Rs. 50,000/-</li>
              <li>Overpayment of premiums with a request for a refund of the amount overpaid</li>
              <li>Request for a purchase of policy in amount considered beyond his apparent need;</li>
              <li>Unusual terminating of policies and refunds;</li>
              <li>Inflated or totally fraudulent claims e.g. by arson or other means causing a fraudulent claim made to recover part of the invested illegitimate funds.</li>
              <li>Policy from a place where he does not reside or is employed.</li>
              <li>Borrowing the maximum amount against a policy soon after buying it</li>
              <li>Frequent free look surrenders by customers</li>
              <li>Frequent request for change in addresses</li>
              <li>Assignments to unrelated parties without valid consideration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Special attention is paid to all complex, unusually large transactions and all unusual patterns which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose and transactions. Background including all documents /office records /memorandums pertaining to such transactions, as far as possible, be examined by the Principal Compliance officer for recording his/her findings. Operating offices through Nodal Officer of Regional Office should report the suspicious transactions to FIU-IND within 7 working days of identification in the prescribed formats under advice to Principal Compliance Officer at Head Office. Directors, officers and employees (permanent and temporary) shall be prohibited from disclosing the fact that a SAR or related information of a policyholder/prospect is being reported or provided to the FIU-IND.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas of Concern to Review</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance companies face the challenge of developing an AML program that incorporates insurance agents and brokers, and effectively covers the risks proportionate to its specific products offered. Any areas of concern can be addressed by conducting the following reviews</p>
            <p><strong>Policies and Procedures: </strong> Evaluate policies and procedures to determine adequacy given the institutions’ risks and current industry regulatory requirements</p>
            <p><strong>AML Risk Assessments:</strong>Assess the inherent and residual AML risks related to products, services, customers and geographic exposure</p>
            <p><strong>Model Validations and AML Automated System Data Validation: </strong>Determine if the appropriate AML models and systems are effectively implemented</p>
            <p><strong>Independent Audits: </strong>Conduct independent reviews and detailed AML transactional testing to ensure the program’s ongoing compliance</p>
            <p><strong>Training:</strong> Review staff training programs to ensure adequate coverage of relevant responsibilities under the program</p>
            <p><strong>Risk-Based Review: </strong>Determine and assess the total effectiveness of AML-related processes and internal controls in relation to the specific products, services, customers and geographies of the company, including staffing levels and expertise, customer due diligence processes, effectiveness of the monitoring processes in place to identify and report suspicious activities, and the integration of insurance agents and brokers into the program</p>
            <p><strong>Independent/Outsourced Due Diligence and Sanctions Screening: </strong>Identify beneficial ownership structures, negative news and sanctions screening for customers, vendors and transaction parties</p>
            <p><strong>Products Exempted from AML Purview</strong></p>
            <p>The following categories of products/business lines may be exempted from the purview of AML requirements,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standalone medical/health insurance products.</li>
              <li>Reinsurance and retrocession contracts</li>
              <li>Group insurance businesses issued to a company, financial institution, or association.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(B) Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance regulator IRDAI has issued Anti Money Laundering (AML) guidelines that include strict adherence of KYC norms by insurance companies. The AML makes it mandatory for insurers to comply with 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) norms by obtaining documents to clearly establish the customer identity in case of all new insurance contracts. Where premium is Rs 1 lakh per annum in case of individual policies, a detailed due diligence should be exercised to establish KYC </p>
            Three Criteria
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Identification of name</li>
              <li>Identification of residence</li>
              <li>Identification of source of funds / net worth.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Exercising KYC Norms</strong></p>
            <p>A list of documents to be verified at the time of accepting the risk / payout or refund more than INR one lac for compliance with KYC requirement for individuals and others is prescribed as per the guidelines. Further, the insurer would not enter into a contract with a customer whose identity matches with any person with known criminal background or with banned entities and those reported to have links with terrorists or terrorist organizations</p>

            <h3 id="five41">Point of Sale (POS) Persons</h3>
            <p>To increase insurance penetration in the country, the industry needs more distributors to travel the last mile. To achieve that goal, what’s needed is a simple certification process for these distributors. So, to get such distributors on board quickly, the IRDAI, in 2015, allowed for a new type of distributor, called the point of sale (POS) person. Given that these individuals have a lower qualification and training threshold, compared to other insurance distributors such as agents, brokers and corporate agents, IRDAI has allowed these individuals to sell only basic insurance products, which do not require a lot of underwriting.</p>
            <p><strong>Mandate of a POS Person </strong></p>
            <p>As per the regulator, products such as motor insurance, travel insurance and personal accident insurance require very little underwriting as they are based on information provided by the prospect. Also, such insurance policies are automatically generated by the system. Therefore, the intervention required for such products is minimal and the training and exams for such persons could be of a lesser degree than those for a full-fledged distributor. In fact, in November 2017, IRDAI had allowed the life insurance industry to use point of sale persons to sell life insurance products. For this, it identified products that are simple to understand, and in which the benefits are stated upfront and they are fixed and predefined. Accordingly, IRDAI identified pure-term insurance plans with and without return of premium, non-linked (non-participating) endowment plans that state the investment benefits upfront and immediate annuity as products that can be sold by the POS persons. And this year, in order to ensure faster certification of POS persons, the regulator has relaxed the certification programme by allowing the insurers or intermediaries hiring them to train and examine these individuals in-house. </p>
            <p><strong>A New Training Programme</strong></p>
            <p>POS persons can be engaged either directly by insurers or by intermediaries such as corporate agents and insurance brokers. The new POS guidelines allow intermediary players in the insurance sector such as brokers giving comparative insurance rates to appoint agents to work on their behalf. Under previous guidelines, only insurers could appoint dedicated agents for their business and one agent could sell policies only for one company. On the other hand, POS certified agents of brokers are allowed to solicit and sell retail insurance products for various insurance companies on the condition that they should already be pre-underwritten. This for example includes motor insurance, simple health insurance and travel insurance. As per the latest guidelines, brokers with online comparison portals can now have agents working for them. What this primarily means is that apart from their primary platform that is – online sales, these intermediaries can now also have offline sales agents to push sales in under penetrated markets. All the benefits of the online platform such as lower rates, hassle free policy issuance, on the spot policy issuance etc can now be made available through a robust combination of physical agents and digital technology. This will lead to easier availability of auto insurance, say for example, in a petrol pump or a neighborhood store. Easier availability and sufficient push from insurers/intermediaries will also improve insurance renewal and policy issuance, especially in the two-wheeler segment. In the latest move to promote further insurance penetration, IRDAI has also allowed insurance intermediaries such as brokers to sponsor the training and certification of POS agents. Allowing intermediaries to appoint POS persons to sell retail insurance will ensure greater adherence to insurance requirements as well as improve insurance density by making policy purchase extremely convenient and easily available. </p>
            <p>The minimum educational qualification of such persons is Class 10 and they should be 18 years of age at least. Earlier, as per the rules, IRDAI had appointed the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) to conduct the examination of certificate for point of sale persons. But in a notification dated 7 February, IRDAI removed this condition for the life insurance industry. Training and certification from NIELIT is no longer mandatory. As per an insurance official, this was done after representations were made to the regulator that this could hamper quick on-boarding of point of sales persons. Accordingly, IRDAI has allowed in-house training by the insurer or intermediary engaging the POS persons. They will have to conduct an in-house training of 15 hours and an examination thereafter. The insurer or the intermediary will then issue a certificate and maintain the records for at least 5 years. IRDAI has, however, prescribed a model syllabus for training purposes. As per the insurers we spoke to, the syllabus has been drafted by the Life Insurance Council and IRDAI, and will be used by all the insurers.</p>
            <p><strong>Products Solicited and Marketed by POS Person</strong></p>
            <p>The POS person can sell only the following pre-underwritten product. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Motor comprehensive insurance package policy for two-wheeler, private car and commercial vehicles.</li>
              <li>Third party liability (act only) policy for two-wheeler, private car and commercial vehicles.</li>
              <li>Personal accident policy</li>
              <li>Travel insurance policy</li>
              <li>Home insurance policy</li>
              <li>Any other policy specifically approved by the authority</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The POS person can sell Life Insurance Products filed with and approved by the authority as POS-Life Products, which may be </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pure Term Insurance product with or without return of premium</li>
              <li>Non-linked (Non-Participating) Endowment product
                  Immediate Annuity Product</li>
              <li>Any other product / product category, if permitted by the Authority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every policy sold through the POS person shall be separately identified and pre-fixed by the name POS – (name of product). The insurance company shall file the product with the Authority under the file use guidelines for information.</p>
            <p>IRDAI has received requests from many insurers to allow indemnity based health insurance products to be sold through POS. On examination of the request made, the authority under the powers vested with it under clause V(1)(f), of the said guidelines, has decided to allow individual indemnity based health insurance products to be solicited through PoS channel with the following conditions,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The indemnity based health insurance products may be offered to only individual policyholders excluding groups and government scheme.</li>
              <li>INR 5 lacs per life/individual will be the maximum sum insured</li>
              <li>Number of such products that can be filed as POS product is capped at 3 (three) per insurance company</li>
              <li>Since health indemnity products follow a different process than health benefit products, which were hitherto included in the POS’P channel, the POS’P may be educated about the process involved in preferring claims, particularly the cashless claims who in turn shall educate the holder of indemnity based health insurance product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tagging of Proposal Form and Insurance Policy to POS Person</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every proposal form, in paper or in paperless form, insurance policy and other related documents shall carry provision to record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN card number in order to tag the policy to the POS person who is selling the said policy. </li>
              <li>The insurance company shall be responsible to record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN card number of the POS person in the proposal form and insurance policy. The insurancecompany shall be responsible for the conduct of the POS person representing him and any misconduct on part of the POS person shall make it liable to a penalty as per provisions of Section 102 of the Act. </li>
              <li>For sales effected through the insurance intermediary, the insurance intermediary shall record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN card number of the POS person in the proposal form and require insurance company to do the same in the insurance policy. The insurance intermediary shall be responsible for the conduct of the POS person engaged by it and any misconduct on part of the POS person shall make it liable to a penalty as per provisions of Section 102 of the Act.</li>
              <li>One of the factors that shall be considered while renewing the certificate of registration of the insurance intermediary, shall be the conduct of the POS person on the rolls of insurance intermediary. </li>
            </ul>

              <p><strong>KEY POINTS</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is incumbent upon the insurers on continuous basis to have in place an independent and transparent grievance redress machinery to resolve grievances in conformity with Redress of Public Grievances Rules, 1998. Apart from this, Regulation 5 of the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders Interests) Regulations, 2006, stipulate that every insurer shall have in place, proper procedures and effective mechanism to address complaints and grievances of policyholders efficiently and with speed</li>
                <li>Every company has instituted an in-house grievance settlement procedure. And the policyholders who have a complaint against the insurer are required to first approach the Grievance/Customer Complaint Cell of the concerned insurer.</li>
                <li>IRDAI has established its own grievance cell at its headquarter for discontented insurance customers. A recent introduction by IRDAI for the facilitation of policyholder is IRDAI Grievance Call Centre (IGCC). IGCC acts as an additional and easily accessible channel for policy holders to lodge their grievances and also seek their status over phone/email</li>
                <li>IGMS will act as a gateway for policyholders to register their complaints with the insurance companies first and if required these complaints can then be escalated directly to the IRDAI Grievance Cell</li>
                <li>Apart from the complaints registered in the IGMS Portal of IRDAI, Complaints registered in DARPG Portal against insurers are also referred to IRDAI.</li>
                <li>The consumer law provides protection to all affected consumer whose insurance services suffer from the deficiencies and defects. The act however restricts the ambit and scope of the power of the consumer court to award compensation to the aggrieved policyholder</li>
                <li>These days, the use of arbitration clause in consumer contracts is on the rise – it is commonly found in consumer contracts for insurance policies, gift redemption offers, or home or car loans from finance companies.</li>
                <li>If a policyholder is unhappy with the company’s response, he can approach the insurance ombudsman in his city 30 days after you first lodged the complaint with the insurer. It is a quasi-judicial body which deals with cases up to a value of Rs 20 lakh and has the power to award compensation to aggrieved policyholders.</li>
                <li>In a major move to protect consumer interests and curb malpractices in India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (‘IRDAI’), on 30 June 2017, notified the IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2017, which supersedes the existing IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002. </li>
                <li>Every insurer shall place in its website the terms and conditions of every insurance product that is offered for sale by the insurer as it was approved by the authority under file and use procedure or filed with the authority under use and file procedure, including products modified or products withdrawn.</li>
                <li>Except in cases of a marine insurance cover, where current market practices do not insist on a written proposal form, in all cases, a proposal for grant of a cover, either for life business or for general business, must be evidenced by a written document</li>
                <li>A request received by insurer for free look cancellation of the policy shall be processed and premium refunded within 15 days of receipt of the request.</li>
                <li>Every insurer shall inform and keep informed periodically the insured on the requirements to be fulfilled by the insured regarding lodging of a claim arising in terms of the policy and the procedures to be followed by him to enable the insurer to settle a claim early.</li>
                <li>Matters to be stated in life insurance, general insurance and health insurance as well as claims procedures related to life, general and health insurance has been specified the Protection of Policyholders Interest Regulations, 2017, which all insurers must follow</li>
                <li>The policyholder shall furnish all information that is sought from him by the insurer and also any other information which the insurer considers as having a bearing on the risk to enable the latter to assess properly the risk sought to be covered by a policy</li>
                <li>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 brought into force with effect from 1st July 2005 (amended from time to time). The act is applicable to all the financial institutions which include insurance companies: Life and Non-Life, Public Sector and private Sector. Insurance companies must develop a written, risk-based BSA/AML program addressing the covered insurance products.</li>
                <li>Along with implementing an adequate BSA/AML program, insurance companies are subject to Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements. Companies are required to submit a SAR to the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.</li>
                <li>Insurance regulator IRDAI has issued Anti Money Laundering (AML) guidelines that include strict adherence of KYC norms by insurance companies. The AML makes it mandatory for insurers to comply with 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) norms by obtaining documents to clearly establish the customer identity in case of all new insurance contracts.</li>
                <li>PoS persons can be engaged either directly by insurers or by intermediaries such as corporate agents and insurance brokers.</li>
                <li>Accordingly, IRDAI has allowed in-house training by the insurer or intermediary engaging the point of sale persons. They will have to conduct an in-house training of 15 hours and an examination thereafter</li>
                <li>For sales effected through the insurance intermediary, the insurance intermediary shall record the Aadhaar card number or the PAN card number or the PoS person in the proposal form and require insurance company to do the same in the insurance policy</li>

            <h2 id="six122">SYNOPSIS</h2>
            <h3 id="six112">Introduction to Insurance</h3>
            <p>This material explains the meaning of risk, different types of risks and the risk management techniques that can be used to reduce losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Peril:</strong>An event or incident that may cause a loss is caused a peril. Insurance cannot avoid or stop an event from happening. It can only help compensate the losses. Insurance can compensate only financial losses. Examples of Peril, Fire, Flood, Earthquakes, Landslide, lightening.</p>
            <p><strong>Classification of Risks</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Catastrophic – Single event leads to higher than usual number/amount of claims on the insurer</li>
              <li>Financial risks- Loss from risk can be quantified in monetary terms</li>
              <li>Non financial risks- loss from risk cannot be measured in monetary terms</li>
              <li>Dynamic risk- Risks resulting from changes in the economy</li>
              <li>Static risks- Loss from risk due to perils of nature and dishonesty of other individuals</li>
              <li>Pure risks- These risks are not under the control of the person</li>
              <li>Speculative risk- In these risks there is a chance of gain or loss</li>
              <li>Fundamental risks- These risks affect a lot of people together</li>
              <li>Particular risks- These risks affect only specific persons </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hazard: </strong>Hazard is a condition that increases the chance of risk.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Physical Hazard refers to characteristics and qualities of subject matter to be insured.</li>
              <li>Moral Hazard refers to the character of the person approaching for insurance</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Risk Management </strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Prevent/avoid the risk</li>
              <li>Reduce the risk</li>
              <li>Retain the risk </li>
              <li>Transfer the risk</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Risk management formally evolved a function of business enterprise but applies to individual risk. An individual can transfer risk on his life to an insurance company by purchasing life insurance policy.</p>
            <h3 id="six21">Concept of Insurance</h3>
            <p>An insurance company (referred to usually as the insurer) promises to pay to the owner (insured) or beneficiary of the asset, a certain sum of money (sum assured),if   a loss occurs to ensure continuance of the financial benefits. The insured pays a certain amount (consideration) to the insurance company for bearing the risk, which is known as a premium. The business of insurance is related to the protection of the economic value of the assets. An asset is valuable for the owners because they get benefit s from it in the form of a comfort and convenience.</p>
            <p><strong>Evolution of Insurance</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance evolved in India in 18th Century. In 1818, the Oriental Life Insurance company was the first life Insurance company to start insurance operations in Calcutta.</p>
            <p><strong>How Insurance Works and Concept of Pooling</strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>People exposed to similar risk are brought together</li>
              <li>Insurance company acts as an intermediary</li>
              <li>Mutual consent among group members to share the loss and compensate the person who suffered the loss</li>
              <li>Compensation is expected to put the person in the same place, financially, as before suffering the loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Insurance Contract</strong></p>
            <p>Insurance is a contract between two parties the insurance company and the policyholder. The insurance policy would specify the following</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The  risk which is the subject matter of the contract</li>
              <li>The event upon which the liability of the insurer would arise </li>
              <li>The nature of liability of the insurer , the amount and the manner of payment</li>
              <li>The amount and the manner of payment of premium by the policyholder</li>
              <li>Other obligations if any of the policyholder</li>
              <li>Consequences of any obligations by the policyholder</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Principle of Insurable interest </strong></p>
            <p>A person is said to have an insurable interest when they stand to gain or benefit from the continued existence (safety) and well being of the person or property insured and would suffer a financial loss if there is damage to the person or property.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Indemnity </strong></p>
            <p>Insurance is meant to indemnify/compensate the losses. Accordingly to the principle of indemnity, insurance should place the insured in the same financial position after the loss,  as they enjoyed before it, not better. The principle of indemnity makes sure that the insurance company compensates the insured only to the extent of the loss so that the insured does not profit from insurance.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Subrogation</strong></p>
            <p>The substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim, demand or right, so that he or she who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to the debt or claim, and its rights, remedies or securities. Subrogation ensues having paid the claim, the insurance company gets the right to make good the damages from the party who caused the loss. Having been indemnified by the insurer, the insured does not retain the right to get compensated by the party who caused the loss and thus makes profit from insurance. Subrogation ensures insurance company is entitled to recover money from the third party but only to the extent it has paid as compensation to the insured person.</p>
            <p><strong>Principle of Contribution</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of contribution ensures that if there is more than one insurance policy drawn up  on the same subject matter, the insured cannot recover their loss from all the insurers , in which case they will recover more  than their loss, or even make a profit.</p>
            <p>Contribution</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The insured does not profit by making separate claims rom multiple companies for the same event.</li>
              <li>Each insurer pays only their proportionate share of the loss.</li>
              <li>The principles of subrogation and contribution apply only to contracts of indemnity. So the two principles do not apply for Life Insurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Principle of Utmost Good faith</strong></p>
            <p>As per the principle of utmost good faith, the proposer is obliged to declare all relevant facts that are material to the assessment of the risk, at the time of making the proposal. This information is important for the insurer in deciding whether to accept the proposal and the appropriate premium to be charged. </p>
            <p><strong>Material Facts</strong></p>
            <p>A fact is said to be material, if it affects the decision of the underwriter to accept or reject the risk or to determine rates, terms, and conditions if the risk is accepted. That is, if that “fact” is relevant to the assessment of the risk and determination of the premium.</p>
            <p>Principle of Utmost good faith will be breached, by giving wrong information and by not disclosing material facts. The Insurance Company should declare all the relevant information and benefits of the product to the customer. </p>
            <p><strong>Proximate Cause </strong></p>
            <p>Proximate cause is defined as the active and efficient cause that sets in motion a chain of events which brings about a result, without the intervention of any force started and working actively from a new and independent source. . The dominant, effective or operative cause of an event is known as the proximate cause.</p>

            <p>Hospitalisation indemnity plans offered for Individuals, as a family floater and also as a group.  Typically theses plans reimburse the following expenses.</p>

            <ol type="1">
              <li>Hospital costs. Accommodation costs, nursing care, operation theatre expenses, specialist s consultation and physiotherapy received as in patient.</li>
              <li> Specialists’ fees. Surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s fee for in patient and day care procedures</li>
              <li> Physicians fees for  in-patient treatment</li>
              <li> Cost of medicines, diagnostic test etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Pre-existing conditions ( conditions the insured had before taking out the insurance)are usually excluded from coverage for a defined period (in 2008, the General Insurance Council  decided to cap the waiting period for pr existing conditions to 4 yeas). These products generally exclude the following.</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li> Drug abuse</li>
              <li> Self inflicted injuries</li>
              <li>Out-patient treatment</li>
              <li> HIV/AIDS of sexually transmitted diseases</li>
              <li> Cosmetic surgery (unlinked  to burns or cancer)</li>
              <li>Preventive treatment/ immunisations etc.</li>
              <li>Maternity and termination of pregnancy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Usually the condition for eligibility for this benefit payment is that the insured has to be hospitalised for atleast 24 hours  This is however, waived for certain defined day care surgical procedures where due to technological  advancement, the patient can undergo surgery and be discharged on the same day.  In these policies, pre hospitalisation and post hospitalisation also covered with capping on no of days.  For example pre hospitalisation expenses for 30 days and post hospitalisation expenses for 60 days covered and policy conditions spell these benefits with clarity.  Recently these products have seen the introduction of many cost sharing provisions like,</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Sub limits on specific surgeries, ailments, components of the hospital costs.</li>
              <li> Co payments (also called co insurance)  where a defined share of the costs are borne by the insured and</li>
              <li> Deductible ( also called excess)  where the initial  defined amount , of hospital costs are borne by the policyholder  after which the coverage starts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These help to reduce the moral hazard , and contribute to lower the overall costs for the insurer, which also means that the reduced insurers liability can fow to  the customer in the form of reduced premium. </p>
