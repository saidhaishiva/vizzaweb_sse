                        <strong>1.1 Introduction</strong><br>
                        A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of
                        programs to access those data. This is a collection of related data with an implicit
                        meaning and hence is a database. The collection of data, usually referred to as the
                        database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is
                        to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and
                        efficient. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit
                        meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the
                        people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book, or you
                        may have stored it on a diskette, using a personal computer and software such as DBASE
                        IV or V, Microsoft ACCESS, or EXCEL. A datum – a unit of data – is a symbol or a set
                        of symbols which is used to represent something. This relationship between symbols and
                        what they represent is the essence of what we mean by information. Hence, information
                        is interpreted data – data supplied with semantics. Knowledge refers to the practical use
                        of information. While information can be transported, stored or shared without many
                        difficulties the same can not be said about knowledge. Knowledge necessarily involves a
                        personal experience. Referring back to the scientific experiment, a third person reading
                        the results will have information about it, while the person who conducted the experiment
                        personally will have knowledge about it.
                        Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management of
                        data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing
                        mechanisms for the manipulation of information. In addition, the database system must
                        ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or attempts at
                        unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the system must avoid
                        possible anomalous results.
                        Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists have
                        developed a large body of concepts and techniques for managing data. These concepts
                        and technique form the focus of this book. This chapter briefly introduces the principles
                        of database systems.
